      Earlier this week the NASA mission OSIRIS-REx returned a sample of the asteroid Bennu to Earth. The YouTube comments on
      many such stories really need to be seen to be believed.<sup><a class="note" ; href="#fn2">1</a></sup> Here, for
      instance, we see a member of the retreival team beginning to inspect the payload:
      <br>

      <a href='https://postimg.cc/75D3b1FL' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/YCLbnb8Q/IMG-1844.jpg'
          border='0' alt='IMG-1844' /></a><br /><code
        style="font-style: italic; font-size: small;"><br>YouTube Comment Exchange:<br>"They expect us to believe that's a real Hazmat suit with the hair showing, lol"<br>"Dude that's a sweatshirt"</code><br />
      <br>
      Another such discussion involved an artist's rendition of the probe gathering the sample, the comments were filled with things like,
      "there's
      no
      way that's real" and "they can't possibly think that we would believe this". There must be some form of brain
      damage associated with this kind of thinking. Or at least, one might think that, but for the sheer <i>number</i> of
      these types of comments. YouTube community post comments
      for major news outlets are an absolute goldmine for this kind of stuff — and this is not a minority of the
      comments — it's a loud <i>majority</i>. It could be NASA missions, someone having a heart attack ("musta been the jab"), or whatever else.
      <br><br>
      AI development
      will
      exacerbate this in myriad ways. Even if all future development of LLMs,
      StableDiffusion, DeepFake technologies, etc, were halted today, we are still in for a world of
      trouble with what's already available.<sup><a class="note" ; href="#fn2">2</a></sup> <sup><a class="note" ;
          href="#fn3">3</a></sup>
      People won't only believe that AI generated content is human-generated, but they'll believe, with probably
      increasing ferocity, that <i>real</i> content has been faked. If the majority of content on the internet is still
      created by humans, that won't be the case for long.<sup><a class="note" ; href="#fn4">4</a></sup>
      <br><br>
      With outside-the-box approaches we can develop tools to help fight against some of this in the short-term.
      Search engines like Marginalia<sup><a class="note" ; href="#fn5">5</a></sup> can be used to do 'reverse SEO' searching to find some old-school
      human content. This type of search is a welcome reprieve from the modern internet's
      litany of
      listicles, AI generated spam, and bloatsites.
    </p>
    <blockquote>The purpose of [marginalia search] is primarily to help you find and navigate the non-commercial parts of the internet. Where, for sure, you’ll find crack-pots, communists, libertarians, anarchists, strange religious cults, snake oil peddlers, really strong opinions. Yes all manner of strange people.<br>...<br>If you are looking for facts you can trust, this is almost certainly the
      wrong tool. If you are looking
      for serendipity, you’re on the right track. When was the last time you just stumbled onto something interesting,
      by the way?<sup><a class="note" ; href="#fn5">5</a></sup></blockquote>
    <p class="pbody">
      As for the ancillary issue, well... people have always believed wacky things, right? Yes, conservatives are going
      a little
      bit crazy right now,<sup><a class="note";
          href="#fn6">6</a></sup> and they're louder and more radical on the internet, but we can
      always hope for a bit of ebb with
      the flow. <br><br> Good luck with your AI assisted truth — I'd rather go through the marginalia.
