				<div class="text"><p>Today there are many mod¬≠els of loud¬≠speak¬≠ers, pro¬≠duced in dif¬≠fer¬≠ent sizes. These mod¬≠els gen¬≠er¬≠al¬≠ly use the clas¬≠sic method intro¬≠duced by Wern¬≠er von Siemens, founder of Siemens, in the 19<sup>th</sup> Cen¬≠tu¬≠ry. This method con¬≠sists of cou¬≠pling a mag¬≠net with the move¬≠ment of a cop¬≠per coil to vibrate a cone-shaped membrane. </p>
<p>These first two ele¬≠ments are already heavy, space-con¬≠sum¬≠ing, and expen¬≠sive to pro¬≠duce. But they could well be replaced, in addi¬≠tion to the cone-shaped mem¬≠brane, by a sim¬≠ple dielec¬≠tric elas¬≠tomer mem¬≠brane, and some sci¬≠en¬≠tif¬≠ic magic.</p>
<p>Elas¬≠tomer, more com¬≠mon¬≠ly known as rub¬≠ber, is an extreme¬≠ly flex¬≠i¬≠ble mate¬≠r¬≠i¬≠al. Its dielec¬≠tric prop¬≠er¬≠ties means that this new mem¬≠brane con¬≠ducts very lit¬≠tle elec¬≠tri¬≠cal cur¬≠rent. By adding a con¬≠duc¬≠tive grease (form¬≠ing an elec¬≠trode) to each side of the mem¬≠brane, a trans¬≠mit¬≠ted elec¬≠tri¬≠cal sig¬≠nal will cause the flex¬≠i¬≠ble mate¬≠r¬≠i¬≠al to react, caus¬≠ing the vibra¬≠tions nec¬≠es¬≠sary to send sound waves.</p>

</p><h2><strong>Improving the materials used</strong></h2>

<p>‚ÄúTo pro¬≠duce a per¬≠fect loud¬≠speak¬≠er, three cri¬≠te¬≠ria must be met: effi¬≠cien¬≠cy, spec¬≠tral bal¬≠ance, and lin¬≠ear¬≠i¬≠ty,‚Äù explains Olivi¬≠er Doar√©. The aim is to emit as much acoustic ener¬≠gy as pos¬≠si¬≠ble with as lit¬≠tle elec¬≠tri¬≠cal ener¬≠gy as pos¬≠si¬≠ble (effi¬≠cien¬≠cy). It is also nec¬≠es¬≠sary to repro¬≠duce the trans¬≠mit¬≠ted elec¬≠tri¬≠cal sig¬≠nal as faith¬≠ful¬≠ly as pos¬≠si¬≠ble in the form of an acoustic wave (spec¬≠tral bal¬≠ance). And this is true regard¬≠less of the desired sound pow¬≠er (lin¬≠ear¬≠i¬≠ty).</p>
<blockquote readability="9" data-sanitized-class="wp-block-quote">
<p>To pro¬≠duce a per¬≠fect loud¬≠speak¬≠er, three cri¬≠te¬≠ria must be respect¬≠ed: effi¬≠cien¬≠cy, spec¬≠tral bal¬≠ance, and linearity.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Espe¬≠cial¬≠ly since the role of loud¬≠speak¬≠ers is not nec¬≠es¬≠sar¬≠i¬≠ly to emit the loud¬≠est sound, but rather to remain faith¬≠ful to the sound it reflects. The choice of a dielec¬≠tric elas¬≠tomer mem¬≠brane could not only light¬≠en the object, but also pro¬≠duce a sound that is just as cor¬≠rect, if a few con¬≠di¬≠tions are met. All this, through a much less expen¬≠sive production.</p>
<p>‚ÄúResearch inter¬≠est in dielec¬≠tric elas¬≠tomers has been grow¬≠ing since the 2000s<em><a href="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/columns/science/loudspeakers-new-materials-in-acoustics/#note-4" data-sanitized-id="note-content-4"><sup>4</sup></a></em>,‚Äù states Corinne Rou¬≠by. ‚ÄúBut the appli¬≠ca¬≠tions were not direct¬≠ly linked to loud¬≠speak¬≠ers.‚Äù How¬≠ev¬≠er, the char¬≠ac¬≠ter¬≠is¬≠tics of this type of mate¬≠r¬≠i¬≠al quick¬≠ly placed it in the acoustic domain. ‚ÄúCon¬≠ven¬≠tion¬≠al loud¬≠speak¬≠ers are heavy and quite expen¬≠sive to pro¬≠duce. This is due to the use of mag¬≠nets, which are not nec¬≠es¬≠sary,‚Äù she says.</p>

</figure><p>The idea of the dielec¬≠tric elas¬≠tomer mem¬≠brane could there¬≠fore replace both the coil and the mag¬≠net. Lighter in weight, this new design looks promis¬≠ing for the loud¬≠speak¬≠er indus¬≠try, but is still in an exper¬≠i¬≠men¬≠tal phase. ‚ÄúThis the¬≠sis, although com¬≠plet¬≠ed, is still intend¬≠ed to enrich the research,‚Äù explains the researcher. The next step is in the hands of a post-doc¬≠tor¬≠al chemist whose objec¬≠tive is to improve the cou¬≠pling between the var¬≠i¬≠ous materials. </p>
<p>
</p><h2><strong>Constraints to overcome </strong></h2>

<p>This type of loud¬≠speak¬≠er is still only at the exper¬≠i¬≠men¬≠tal stage, and its indus¬≠tri¬≠al¬≠i¬≠sa¬≠tion will not be for tomor¬≠row. The results are promis¬≠ing enough to mer¬≠it fur¬≠ther inves¬≠ti¬≠ga¬≠tion, but they do reveal sev¬≠er¬≠al con¬≠straints that still need to be overcome.</p>
<p>‚ÄúFirst, the elas¬≠tomer mem¬≠brane is flex¬≠i¬≠ble, but also very frag¬≠ile. Too much volt¬≠age can cause an elec¬≠tric arc and make the mem¬≠brane unus¬≠able,‚Äù explains Corinne Rou¬≠by. This is par¬≠tic¬≠u¬≠lar¬≠ly true for low fre¬≠quen¬≠cies, which require a lot of ener¬≠gy to trans¬≠mit, and which lead to greater move¬≠ments that make the mem¬≠brane more fragile. </p>
<p>For this new type of loud¬≠speak¬≠er, the researchers worked on the shape to be giv¬≠en to the elec¬≠trodes (through the con¬≠duc¬≠tive grease), to pro¬≠duce any type of fre¬≠quen¬≠cy. ‚ÄúEach mode of vibra¬≠tion can cause res¬≠o¬≠nances in the object,‚Äù explains the researcher. It is there¬≠fore nec¬≠es¬≠sary to con¬≠trol them so that the speak¬≠er does not favour cer¬≠tain fre¬≠quen¬≠cies<em><a href="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/columns/science/loudspeakers-new-materials-in-acoustics/#note-5" data-sanitized-id="note-content-5"><sup>5</sup></a></em>. Fre¬≠quen¬≠cy bal¬≠ance can also be achieved by fil¬≠ter¬≠ing the elec¬≠tri¬≠cal sig¬≠nal sent to the loud¬≠speak¬≠er<em><a href="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/en/columns/science/loudspeakers-new-materials-in-acoustics/#note-6" data-sanitized-id="note-content-6"><sup>6</sup></a></em>.</p>
<figure data-sanitized-class="wp-block-image size-full"><img decoding="async" src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://www.polytechnique-insights.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/video_haut-parleurs_cut-1.mov" alt data-sanitized-class="wp-image-15752"></figure><p>A major con¬≠straint was also iden¬≠ti¬≠fied: ‚Äúin the lab¬≠o¬≠ra¬≠to¬≠ry, our loud¬≠speak¬≠er was accom¬≠pa¬≠nied by a pres¬≠sure con¬≠troller that made it pos¬≠si¬≠ble to man¬≠age the var¬≠i¬≠ous leaks with¬≠in the cav¬≠i¬≠ty. To imag¬≠ine such a mech¬≠a¬≠nism in a liv¬≠ing room is not yet pos¬≠si¬≠ble,‚Äù she con¬≠cedes. Although this her¬≠met¬≠ic prob¬≠lem is real, it is a tech¬≠ni¬≠cal con¬≠straint that Corinne Rou¬≠by does not con¬≠sid¬≠er insurmountable.</p>
<p>Once these obsta¬≠cles have been over¬≠come, this type of loud¬≠speak¬≠er can be mas¬≠sive¬≠ly indus¬≠tri¬≠alised. Less expen¬≠sive and lighter, its appli¬≠ca¬≠tions can be dreamed of. Olivi¬≠er Doar√©, co-direc¬≠tor of this the¬≠sis, is cur¬≠rent¬≠ly work¬≠ing on a sim¬≠i¬≠lar sys¬≠tem for head¬≠phones. By using mem¬≠branes, this time piezo¬≠elec¬≠tric, this sci¬≠en¬≠tif¬≠ic advance could soon be in our ears. </p>

Matthews told Raymond Lech that he advised Schwable to write what he wanted, but ‚Äúanything that he said or wrote could be used against him in a court-martial‚Äù (pg. 147, <em data-sanitized-class="nb">Tortured Into Fake Confession</em>).</p><p data-sanitized-id="a9d3" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">One wonders if at that moment Schwable recalled what he had written in his BW confession to the Chinese.

Matthews offered to have CIC fix it up. He took the draft statement back to where the Joint Intelligence Processing Board had its administrative offices and had typists work on it.

But the main point here is how integrated Mahurin was into highly sensitive and classified operations that would have drawn the attention of the CIA‚Äôs Bissell.</p><p data-sanitized-id="0ba1" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">Mahurin retired from the Air Force in 1956. He noted in <em data-sanitized-class="nb">Honest John</em> that he consulted on this decision with his ‚Äúfriends,‚Äù including General Carl Spaatz, General Ira Eaker, and General Emmett O‚ÄôDonnell. Spaatz had been Commander of Strategic Air Forces in World War II, but at the time Mahurin consulted him he was retired, a member of the Committee of Senior Advisors to the Air Force Chief of Staff. Eaker had been commander of the Eighth Air Force in World War II, and now was vice president at Hughes Aircraft. O‚ÄôDonnell had a storied career, from leading bombing raids against Tokyo, to his command of Far East Bomber Command during the Korean War. In 1956, O‚ÄôConnell was deputy chief of personnel at Air Force headquarters in Washington.</p><p data-sanitized-id="4504" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">Mahurin had very powerful friends.

Oddly, when Mahurin first returned from captivity, it was ‚ÄúDutch Kindelburger, the chairman of the board of North American Aviation‚Äù who paid to have Mahurin‚Äôs wife flown out to meet him in San Francisco (<em data-sanitized-class="nb">Honest John</em>, p. 353). So, Mahurin‚Äôs connection with North American Aviation went back some ways. The company also had connections with the U-2 program, <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/declassification/iscap/pdf/2002-0049-doc-14.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" data-sanitized-class="af nc">developing internal guidance gear</a> for the plane (codenamed ‚ÄúOxcart‚Äù in the accompanying link).</p><p data-sanitized-id="1737" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj"><strong data-sanitized-class="mf gz">Conclusion</strong></p><p data-sanitized-id="cfef" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">There were many, many intelligence figures involved in the processing and later evaluation of the Korean War POWs, including those POWs who confessed to use of germ warfare. Some of these individuals also figured prominently in CIA covert action and/or the biological warfare program of the U.S. government.</p><p data-sanitized-id="4810" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">According to the research presented in this article, the integration of the CIA‚Äôs MKULTRA program and its precursors with the Department of Defense‚Äôs biological weapons program was closer and more intricate than earlier understood. Previously, the best example of such joint activity centered around the connections of Camp Detrick‚Äôs Special Operations Division with the CIA‚Äôs <a href="https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/bs-xpm-2004-08-01-0408010004-story.html" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" data-sanitized-class="af nc">MKNAOMI</a> program, <a href="https://www.archives.gov/files/research/jfk/releases/178-10004-10087.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" data-sanitized-class="af nc">which involved</a> ‚Äúdeveloping special applications for BW agents and toxins.‚Äù Such CIA-Defense Department integration also is apparent in the handling of the returning POWs, including the BW confessors, upon their repatriation to the United States.</p><p data-sanitized-id="542c" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">One cannot ignore the insistence by nearly all establishment commentators that the POW BW confessions were ‚Äúfalse,‚Äù or at least of low evidentiary value. But an <a rel="noopener" href="https://jeff-kaye.medium.com/secret-history-u-s-2ac4c7219bd" data-sanitized-class="af nc">examination of those confessions</a> show they were largely factual, and most likely the contents were produced via a range of levels of collaboration, as West believed. Some were quite willingly produced, due to shock and revulsion over use of biological weapons, while others involved some degree of coercion, ranging from psychological torture of the DDD type West wrote about, to old-fashioned police third degree.</p><p data-sanitized-id="1c1b" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">The retractions of these confessions were not spontaneously produced, but were primarily made under threat of court martial for treason, or other related charge. The Artichoke activities surrounding the returning Little Switch POWs sent to Valley Forge Army Hospital casts a dark shadow over the post-war statements by repatriated Korean War prisoners in general, as does the fact that the officer ostensibly in charge of assessing the POWs responses to captivity, including the confessions they made, James Monroe, was himself involved in the oversight of CIA mind control, ‚Äúbrainwashing‚Äù experiments. During the war he was also intimately involved in joint Air Force-CIA activities in Korea.</p><p data-sanitized-id="0788" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">Given the fact that the claims of torture by the airmen were winnowed though the hands of CIC and CIA intelligence figures, for whom lying and subterfuge were everyday activities, and that the retractions of the flyers‚Äô confessions were given under duress, we must take the claims of torture, as well as the BW retractions themselves, with some degree of suspicion.</p><p data-sanitized-id="a3f4" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">On the other hand, it seems likely in the nature of war and the brutality of the Korean War in particular, within the context of the intensive assault of U.S. forces on the Korean peninsula, including the presumed use of biological weapons, that like many, many armed forces before them, some North Korean and Chinese military and intelligence officers might have turned at times to coercive measures to gain intelligence.</p><p data-sanitized-id="cd3c" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">There‚Äôs also the fact that the very nature of imprisonment itself is a form of coercion, and that would include both the POW prison camp experience as well as the secluded sequestration the BW confessors experienced in the weeks long voyage back to the United States, and subsequent hospital stays (like Valley Forge).</p><p data-sanitized-id="11da" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">From the standpoint of seventy years later, and given the need to address the veracity of germ warfare charges after many years of censorship and obfuscation, it may not be politically correct to admit this, but while the use of coercion, or even torture, may have been used to induce some confessions, it must be admitted that evidence obtained in such manner does not necessarily affect the status of the information provided.</p><p data-sanitized-id="60e0" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">The CIA certainly believed that. As explained in the CIA‚Äôs <a href="https://nsarchive2.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB122/index.htm" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" data-sanitized-class="af nc">1963 KUBARK manual</a> on interrogation, CIA attempted to match forms of interrogation to an assessment of a prisoner‚Äôs personality. CIA interrogators understood that even ‚Äú[r]elatively small degrees of homeostatic derangement, fatigue, pain, sleep loss, or anxiety may impair‚Äù a prisoner‚Äôs mental functioning. They found that if not too extreme, such coercive forms of interrogation were successful in getting prisoners to ‚Äútalk and usually reveal some information that they might not have revealed otherwise‚Äù (p. 83).</p><p data-sanitized-id="82bf" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">Of course, torture also produces false confessions, particularly in those who have no information to impart. From the standpoint of being against torture, the admonition against its use cannot have anything to do with its effectiveness. Such opposition is a matter of morality and larger political expediency, as torture makes enemies, and poisons usual opportunities for cooperation. It also degrades the organizations and societies that permit its use.</p><p data-sanitized-id="e7b9" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">According to intelligence-linked investigators such as Louis Joylan West and Schwable‚Äôs military attorney during his inquest, U.S. military prisoners <em data-sanitized-class="nb">did </em>provide authentic intelligence information to their captors. This was demonstrably true in the Arnold case, though it took over 40 years for the truth to emerge. There is also the admission in an <a href="https://www.usmcu.edu/Portals/218/U_S_%20Marine%20Operations%20in%20Korea%20Vol%205%201950%20-%201953%20%20PCN%2019000264000.pdf" rel="noopener ugc nofollow" target="_blank" data-sanitized-class="af nc">official Marine Corps history</a> of operations in Korea during the war that Schwable‚Äôs confession was ‚Äúunquestionably damaging.‚Äù If it was all lies, how was it damaging?</p><p data-sanitized-id="a848" data-sanitized-class="pw-post-body-paragraph md me gy mf b mg mh mi mj mk ml mm mn mo mp mq mr ms mt mu mv mw mx my mz na gr bj">The distribution of the airmen confessions, whether those in the ISC report or those published by the People‚Äôs Republic of China itself, was <a rel="noopener" href="https://jeff-kaye.medium.com/censored-north-korea-accused-u-s-of-working-with-unit-731-war-criminals-on-bw-attacks-d7fd819ed8b7" data-sanitized-class="af nc">suppressed</a> in the United States, as well as in allied countries.

</figcaption></figure><p>A federal judge in Texas has a new rule for lawyers in his courtroom: No submissions written by artificial intelligence unless the AI's output is checked by a human. US District Judge Brantley Starr also ordered lawyers to file certificates attesting that their filings are either written or reviewed by humans.</p>
<p>"All attorneys appearing before the Court must file on the docket a certificate attesting either that no portion of the filing was drafted by generative artificial intelligence (such as ChatGPT, Harvey.AI, or Google Bard) or that any language drafted by generative artificial intelligence was checked for accuracy, using print reporters or traditional legal databases, by a human being," according to a new "<a href="https://www.txnd.uscourts.gov/judge/judge-brantley-starr">judge-specific requirement</a>" in Starr's courtroom.</p>
<p>A certification must be submitted for each case and would cover all filings in the case. A sample certification says the requirements apply to any language in a filing, "including quotations, citations, paraphrased assertions, and legal analysis."</p>
<p>Starr, a Trump nominee in US District Court for the Northern District of Texas, said that AI "platforms are incredibly powerful and have many uses in the law: form divorces, discovery requests, suggested errors in documents, anticipated questions at oral argument. But legal briefing is not one of them." AI "platforms in their current states are prone to hallucinations and bias. On hallucinations, they make stuff up‚Äîeven quotes and citations."</p>
<p>Starr's new standing order on AI was posted yesterday, according to an <a href="https://reason.com/volokh/2023/05/30/federal-judge-requires-all-lawyers-to-file-certificates-related-to-use-of-generative-ai/">article by legal expert Eugene Volokh</a>. "Note that federal judges routinely have their own standing orders for lawyers practicing in their courtrooms. These are in addition to the local district rules, and to the normal Federal Rules of Civil and Criminal Procedure," Volokh wrote.</p>
<h2>Lawyer cited fake cases invented by ChatGPT</h2>
<p>Starr's order came after New York-based lawyer Steven Schwartz admitted that he used ChatGPT to help write court filings that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2023/05/lawyer-cited-6-fake-cases-made-up-by-chatgpt-judge-calls-it-unprecedented/">cited six nonexistent cases</a> invented by the artificial intelligence tool. Schwartz and his associates are awaiting possible punishments from Judge Kevin Castel of US District Court for the Southern District of New York.</p>
<p>In what Castel called "an unprecedented circumstance," the judge said filings from the plaintiff's lawyers included six "bogus judicial decisions with bogus quotes and bogus internal citations." The <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/63107798/mata-v-avianca-inc/?filed_after=&amp;filed_before=&amp;entry_gte=&amp;entry_lte=&amp;order_by=desc#entry-29">filings</a> included names of made-up cases and a series of "excerpts" from bogus rulings that cited additional fake precedents invented by AI.</p>
<p>An affidavit filed by Schwartz said he "greatly regrets having utilized generative artificial intelligence to supplement the legal research performed herein and will never do so in the future without absolute verification of its authenticity." He also said he had "never utilized ChatGPT as a source for conducting legal research prior to this occurrence and therefore was unaware of the possibility that its content could be false."</p>
<h2>Judge: AI swears no oath, holds no allegiance</h2>
<p>Starr's new standing order discussed potential biases in AI tools. "While attorneys swear an oath to set aside their personal prejudices, biases, and beliefs to faithfully uphold the law and represent their clients, generative artificial intelligence is the product of programming devised by humans who did not have to swear such an oath," he wrote.</p>
<p>AI "systems hold no allegiance to any client, the rule of law, or the laws and Constitution of the United States (or, as addressed above, the truth)," Starr continued. "Unbound by any sense of duty, honor, or justice, such programs act according to computer code rather than conviction, based on programming rather than principle. Any party believing a platform has the requisite accuracy and reliability for legal briefing may move for leave and explain why."</p>
<p>Going forward, Starr's order said the court "will strike any filing from an attorney who fails to file a certificate on the docket attesting that the attorney has read the Court's judge-specific requirements and understands that he or she will be held responsible under Rule 11 for the contents of any filing that he or she signs and submits to the Court, regardless of whether generative artificial intelligence drafted any portion of that filing."</p></div>

<p><span>In late 1959 Weiner gave a speech to the</span> <em>American Association for the Advancement of Science.</em> <span>In early 1960 it would be adapted and published as a</span> <a href="https://www.cs.umd.edu/users/gasarch/BLOGPAPERS/moral.pdf" rel>paper</a> <span>titled</span> <em>‚ÄòSome Moral and Technical Consequences of Automation.‚Äô</em> <span>The speech began by citing the</span> <a href="https://newsletter.pessimistsarchive.org/p/a-warning-about-ai-from-1863" rel>predictions</a> <span>of Samuel Butler in the 1860s that foretold machines would eventually out-evolve and rule over man, noting they had not come to pass. However, he said it was</span> <em>different this time</em> <span>since machines had become so much more advanced at such a rapid pace.</span></p>

<p><span>Weiner observed that generally people wished slaves to be intelligent</span> <em>and</em> <span>subservient, however</span> <em>‚ÄúComplete subservience and complete intelligence do not go together.‚Äù</em> <span>He‚Äôd posit that</span> <span>like the philosopher slaves of Ancient Greece, machines would eventually outwit their masters, similarly:</span></p>

<p><em><strong>‚Äúif the machines become more and more efficient and operate at a higher and higher psychological level, the catastrophe foreseen by Butler of the dominance of the machine comes nearer and nearer.‚Äù</strong></em></p>

<p><span>These scary predictions, from a pioneer in the field, were taken seriously and generated headlines - much like more recent concerns from AI experts have. Coverage of Weiner‚Äôs warnings referred to him as a new, better educated Samuel Butler. While Butler was a writer and cultural critic, Weiner was an</span> <em>expert</em> <span>and</span> <em>pioneer</em> <span>in computer science - so who were we, or anyone else to question his well informed prognostications?</span></p>

<p><span>This wasn‚Äôt the first time Weiner had voiced concerns about thinking machines, a decade prior his book ‚ÄòCybernetics‚Äô (1948) would voice a number of dystopian predictions about AI. A year after its publication - In 1949 - the editor of The New York Times</span> <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/science/mit-scholars-1949-essay-on-machine-age-is-found.html" rel>asked</a> <span>Weiner to write an op-ed about</span> <em>‚Äúwhat the ultimate machine age is likely to be‚Äù</em> <span>exploring some of they key topics in the book. The first draft was rejected by the editor, who requested another draft, which was thankfully archived (unlike the first):</span></p>

<p><span>In the second draft, Weiner would cite old fables - such as genies in bottles - that he said contained a powerful lesson: if we have the power to realize our wishes</span> <em>‚Äúwe are more likely to use it wrongly than to use it rightly, more likely to use it stupidly than to use it intelligently.‚Äù</em> <span>His prediction, one familiar in the current dialog around AI:</span> <em>‚Äúthe machines will do what we ask them to do and not what we ought to ask them to do.‚Äù</em></p>
<p><span>Weiner also predicted mass unemployment and an ‚Äúindustrial revolution of unmitigated cruelty‚Äù by making ‚Äú</span><em>possible the factory substantially without employees‚Äù,</em> <span>factories</span> <span>that could bankrupt their owners buy taking orders too literally. He voiced similar concerns about autonomous weapons too, which he said</span> <em>"may produce a policy which will win a nominal victory on points at the cost of every interest we have at heart, even of national survival.‚Äù</em></p>
<p>His final line and parting message:</p>
<div readability="9" data-sanitized-class="pullquote">
<p><strong>‚ÄúWe can be humble and live a good life with the aid of the machines, or we can be arrogant and die.‚Äù</strong></p>
</div>
<p>The editor of The New York Times would reject the second draft too, requesting a copy of the first draft - so the best of both could be combined into one piece. Weiner would decline the request citing it would require an impractical amount of co-ordination, something unavoidable in a pre-internet age. If only they‚Äôd had internet, Google Docs and even better - a large language model to help combined the first and second drafts, as we do 74 years later.</p>
<p>Three quarters of a century on the concerns and debates remain the same. While some experts like Yann LeCun push back and are labelled corporate stooges - others make wild prognostications, ones the press treat seriously. They are, in turn heralded as new Samuel Butler‚Äôs, as Norbert Weiner was. Weiner‚Äôs prophecies didn‚Äôt come true, like Samuel Butlers before him, but this time - like last time - it is different.</p>

				<div class="text"><p>2023-06-01</p><p><em><strong>Disclaimer:</strong> If you are unfamiliar with Robert Nystrom's book <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/"><em>Crafting Interpreters</em></a> and the <a href="https://lukemerrick.com/posts/intro_to_julox.html">Lox langauge</a> it presents, parts of this post might be a bit confusing.</em></p>
<h2>Backstory</h2>
<p>Over the past two months, I put together a working tree-walk interpreter for Robert Nystrom's Lox language in Julia. Along the way, I have gone from knowing next to nothing about programming languages to... still knowing next to nothing about programming languages (how do <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hindley%E2%80%93Milner_type_system">Hindley-Milner type systems</a> relate to <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lambda_calculus">Lambda Calculus</a> you ask? Heck if I know!).</p>
<p>Luckily, however, this project did teach me something about putting together a tree-walk interpreter for Lox in Julia. I figure that now that I've crossed the finish line with my implementation, it might be fun to share my opinions and takeaways from the experience.</p>
<p>Also, although I built JuLox while following Nystrom's <code>jlox</code> narrative in chapters 4 through 13 of <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/"><em>Crafting Interpreters</em></a>, I designed and implemented JuLox a bit differently from <code>jlox</code> (particularly around the parser). Anyone who read and enjoyed those chapters of Nystrom's book might find the variations I describe in the next section to be particularly relevant and interesting.</p>
<h2>The JuLox Fan Fiction</h2>
<p>According to the <a href="https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/wiki/Lox-implementations">official <em>Crafting Interpreters</em> wiki</a>, there are two other implementations of Lox in Julia, one called <a href="https://gitlab.com/Natrium729/lox.jl">Lox.jl</a> and one (confusingly) called <a href="https://github.com/nathanleiby/jlox">jlox</a> (to disambiguate from Nystrom's official Java-based <code>jlox</code>, I'll henceforth call this one <code>julia-jlox</code>).</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, both of these tree-walk interpreter implementations are "by the book" at least as much as possible considering <code>jlox</code> is written in object-oriented Java code while Julia is not an object-oriented language. With JuLox, I did a few parts differently in an attempt to play with additional patterns not covered in <em>Crafting Interpreters</em>. Since the components of the <code>jlox</code> recipe map directly onto chapters of <em>Crafting Interpreters</em>, these deviations felt a bit like drafting (or at least outlining), my own little <em>JuLox fan fiction</em>.</p>
<p>Below I'll highlight and explain some of the differences, but first let's start with a visual overview of <code>jlox</code> vs JuLox (the diagram may not fully make sense to you yet, but I promise it'll be a helpful anchor for the rest of this section).</p>

<h3>High-Fidelity Tokenization</h3>
<p>At the end of Chapter 4: Scanning in <em>Crafting Interpreters</em>, Nystrom presents us with Challenge #3 that states:</p>
<blockquote readability="9">
<p>Our scanner here, like most, discards comments and whitespace since those aren‚Äôt needed by the parser. Why might you want to write a scanner that does not discard those? What would it be useful for?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If Nystrom were to follow up with a sequel to <em>Crafting Interpreters</em> called <em>Crafting Linters and Formatters</em> or <em>Crafting Code Analyzers That Let You Ignore Stuff by Adding Special Comments</em>, I trust that he would fill much of the book answering this question. And if he did write such a book, Nystrom might amend his mountain metaphor to include options that abandon code execution entirely and return safely from the peak of analysis back to the basecamp of source code (perhaps via gondola or snowmobile rather than the paraglider I've drawn in).</p>
<p><img alt="an edited version of the Crafting Interpreters mountain analogy" src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lukemerrick.com/posts/static/julox/crafting_interpreters_mountain_edited.png"></p>
<p>In an analyzer, formatter, or linter, comments and whitespace need to be programmatically consumed in order to determine the correct outputs. A concrete example of this is how the <code>flake8</code> Python linter skips sections of code marked with a <code># noqa</code> comment. Ensuring that comments survive tokenization is one way to enable downstream code parsing logic to check for that flag. Another example of why we might want to retain trivia (a fancy name for syntactically inert tokens like comments and whitespace) is to power code autoformatting ‚Äî your formatter can't enforce a particular whitespace convention if tokenization drops all the whitespace!</p>
<p>Accordingly, in my JuLox fan fiction, Tokenization preserves all trivia. Does any part of JuLox actually <em>do something</em> with all this retained trivia? Well, no, not yet at least. But perhaps one day I'll want it, and so for now we hold onto it.</p>
<p>Here's a representative JuLox example that you can run in the Julia REPL to see lossless tokenization in action.</p>
<div readability="9" data-sanitized-class="codehilite">
<pre><code>julia&gt; collect(JuLox.Tokenize.Tokenizer("// Variable declaration.\nvar x = 42;"))
11-element Vector{JuLox.Tokenize.Token}:
 1-24       Comment
 25-25      NewlineWs
 26-28      var
 29-29      Whitespace
 30-30      Identifier
 31-31      Whitespace
 32-32      =
 33-33      Whitespace
 34-35      Number
 36-36      ;
 37-40      EndMarker
</code></pre></div>
<p>One thing to bear in mind is that once you recognize and tag trivia during tokenization, it becomes pretty trivial (pun intended) to ignore or drop it later. Therefore there isn't much of a downside to keeping it around for later, while there is the upside that the tokenizer becomes a more general component suited for building non-interpreter tools like formatters and analyzers as well.</p>
<h3>Streaming Parsing</h3>
<p>Parsers turn token sequences into trees. It says so right there in Chapter 6 ‚Äî "transmogrifying a sequence of tokens into one of those syntax trees." However, in recent years a hip new trend has sprung up in the parser game, possibly invented in (and certainly popularized by) <a href="https://rust-analyzer.github.io/"><code>rust-analyzer</code></a>, of <em>not actually doing that</em>. Instead, these hipster parsers spit out an <em>event stream</em> rather than a syntax tree. Each event in the event stream specifies a syntax kind and token range and can be thought of as corresponding to the inner node of a <em>hypothetical</em> syntax tree.</p>
<p>If you're interested in where I read up on streaming parsing, check out the <a href="https://julialang.github.io/JuliaSyntax.jl/dev/design/">design notes</a> and <a href="https://youtu.be/CIiGng9Brrk?t=800">JuliaCon presentation video</a> for JuliaSyntax.jl (the new Julia parser written in Julia), which give a nice explanation of how this design works and why it's nice.</p>
<p>Why streaming parsing? To me, splitting up parsing from tree creation feels like taking a page from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy">Unix Philosophy</a>'s dictate to "make each program do one thing well." By delegating the responsibility of building a syntax tree to a distinct component of our interpreter pipeline, we also delegate all the important tree-centric decisions like what to do with the trivia we've retained and how to ensure the tree data structure is performant. We could even wire up our same parser to different downstream modules to create different pipelines, e.g. one for linting and one for interpreting, in a clean way.</p>
<p>And so, in my JuLox fan fiction, parsing doesn't build a syntax tree, but rather it spits out a bunch of syntax events that tell us how we <em>could build</em> a syntax tree from our tokens.</p>
<p>Like this.</p>
<div readability="17" data-sanitized-class="codehilite">
<pre><code>julia&gt; JuLox.Parse.parse_lox("{var in_block = 2 + 2;}").events
4-element Vector{JuLox.Parse.Event}:
 JuLox.Parse.Event(K"infix_operation", 7, 12)
 JuLox.Parse.Event(K"var_decl_statement", 2, 13)
 JuLox.Parse.Event(K"block", 1, 14)
 JuLox.Parse.Event(K"toplevel", 1, 14)
</code></pre></div>
<p>One cool side effect of this design decision is that it lets the parser spit out syntax errors as events, letting downstream logic figure out how to stick errors into a syntax tree or otherwise handle them. I find that this keeps the already-involved parser code tamer by separating out the concern of error handling while also keeping our outputs organized.</p>
<div readability="19" data-sanitized-class="codehilite">
<pre><code>julia&gt; JuLox.Parse.parse_lox("{if;}").events
5-element Vector{JuLox.Parse.Event}:
 JuLox.Parse.Event(K"UnparsedErrorRecovery", 4, 5)
 JuLox.Parse.Event(K"expression_statement", 6, 5)
 JuLox.Parse.Event(K"if_statement", 2, 6)
 JuLox.Parse.Event(K"block", 1, 6)
 JuLox.Parse.Event(K"toplevel", 1, 6)
</code></pre></div>
<h3>A Lossless Syntax Tree</h3>
<p>If you look back at the box diagram from the start of this section, I hope by now that you'll feel comfortable with the "syntax events" box on the JuLox side. You might still be wondering, however, about the two different syntax tree boxes work. Well, taking a page from JuliaSyntax.jl, <code>rust-analyzer</code>, the <a href="https://ericlippert.com/2012/06/08/red-green-trees/">Roslyn C# parser</a>, and probably many others, I've decided to continue with the "make each program do one thing well" mindset by keeping initial syntax tree creation as simple as possible, deferring additional complexity (like the task of dropping trivia) to an additional step.</p>
<p>As far as I can tell, various projects that have similarly opted for multiple syntax trees have each had different reasons (often related to performance) for making tree creation so incremental. For me, there was actually no good reason besides wanting to try something new (then again, that's really the only reason I have to build yet another Lox interpreter in the first place).</p>
<p>In JuLox, lossless trees are un-typed (i.e. all nodes from "Block" to "Variable" to "StringLiteral" are instances of either <code>LosslessInnerNode</code> or <code>LosslessLeafNode</code>, rather than having their own types). This has the benefit of making it easier to build a syntax tree out of invalid syntax.</p>
<h3>Syntax Validation as a Separate Step</h3>
<p>Further breaking apart JuLox's parser, I created a separate syntax validation step that runs on the lossless syntax tree. I decided to put syntax validation here in the interpreter pipeline because I thought a tree structure might be easier to validate than an event stream, but I also thought it would be nice not to worry about invalid syntax surviving to the later lossy syntax tree. Upon reflection, however, I don't know if this is a particularly good design choice, because a typed tree structure seems to be a more friendly object to work with when writing validation code. Indeed, according to the <code>rust-analyzer</code> docs, "[m]ost of rust-analyzer works with the ast layer" (its <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/rust-analyzer/blob/master/docs/dev/syntax.md#ast">strongly-typed syntax tree API</a>) for this reason.</p>
<p>The drawback of the <code>rust-analyzer</code> approach of allowing invalid syntax into the final tree, in my eyes, is that when out of necessity all fields are optional to accommodate incomplete and erroneous code, your downstream code needs to be ready for the possibility of missing fields due to erroneous code. Avoiding mistaken assumptions about the non-missingness of required fields is, I imagine, a lot easier with Rust's static sum types, pattern matching, and exacting compiler than it is in other languages like Julia. <code>rust-analyzer</code> also benefits from the fact that it doesn't have to interpret or compile its syntax trees after analysis (since that's the Rust compiler's job).</p>
<p>I should also mention that (at least at the time of writing), the JuLox syntax validation step just checks for error-typed nodes in the tree and doesn't provide any further syntax checks, so maybe this doesn't even need to be its own step.</p>
<h3>Going Lossy</h3>
<p>As noted above, the interpreter doesn't actually need to do anything with all the trivia we've held on to. Thus, as we head toward semantic analysis and interpretation, it's time to finally let go of all those comments and whitespace.</p>
<p>If there are no syntax errors, JuLox proceeds from lossless to lossy by building a second syntax tree on top of the first, lossless, tree, with the lossy tree's nodes holding references to the lossless tree's nodes. There isn't much else to discuss in this step, other than the fact that having this many separate steps of the parser didn't actually feel all that redundant compared to the more streamlined <code>jlox</code> approach.</p>
<h3>Back to the Main Plot</h3>
<p>From lossy tree onward into variable resolution and interpretation, JuLox sticks to the <code>jlox</code> recipe pretty closely, and so we have now reached the end of the JuLox fan fiction. If you look back up to the box diagram above, I bet you'll understand the whole thing now! I hope you enjoyed the tour.</p>
<h2>Other Takeaways from my JuLox Experience</h2>
<p>In addition to my takeaways from splicing my own parser design into the <code>jlox</code> recipe, I have a few takeaways from the project in general to share as well.</p>
<h3>Interactivity is Cool for Crafting Interpreters</h3>
<p>Since Julia is an interpreted language, we can run JuLox's many components incrementally and interactively in the Julia REPL. It only really dawned on me as I got into the project how cool and useful this is. Below is an illustrative example of what it can be like to run your interpreter piece by piece in a REPL. It feels pretty meta to watch your Julia interpreter interpret your Lox interpreter as it interprets some Lox code!</p>

<h3>Low Performance Julia Code</h3>
<p>Another surprising learning from making JuLox was finding out just how slow Julia can be in its edge cases (like operating a tree-walk interpreter). In his book, Nystrom warns us that tree-walk interpreters are slow, and I was curious just how slow this was. To get a rough sense, I ran a recursive Fibonacci sequence benchmark taken straight from the book though a number of different Lox interpreters.</p>
<div readability="8" data-sanitized-class="codehilite">
<pre><code>// Here is the Lox code for the benchmark.
fun fib(n) {
  if (n &lt;= 1) return n;
  return fib(n - 2) + fib(n - 1);
}

for (var i = 0; i &lt; 20; i = i + 1) {
  print fib(i);
}
</code></pre></div>
<p>In Nystrom's <code>jlox</code>, this program takes 0.5 seconds on my laptop, while <code>clox</code> blazes through it in around 0.01 seconds. For a third point of reference, I clocked the <a href="https://github.com/yashrathi-git/loxscript">loxscript Python implementation</a> and got 0.34 seconds, which surprised me as seeming quite snappy compared to <code>jlox</code>.</p>
<p>Next I tried out the Julia-based Lox interpreters, and I was amazed at how much slower they are!</p>
<p>Here's a table of my experiments. I even tried running things repeatedly in a Julia REPL to ensure ahead-of-time compilation after I noticed that JuLox took over a second to handle an empty file (despite my best attempts at precompiling it with <code>PrecompileTools.jl</code>). Even with everything compiled ahead of time, runtimes were still at best about an order of magnitude slower than Python across all three Julia Lox implementations.</p>

<p>Now, I'm not claiming that Julia should do better at this use-case. Implementing a tree-walk interpreter for a dynamically-typed languages is a bit of a niche application after all, and its quite far from Julia's numerical computing focus. However, I was certainly surprised by the slowness, and I was also surprised how profiling JuLox with <code>Profile.jl</code> and <code>ProfileSVG.jl</code> didn't really enlighten me abut any hot spots (perhaps highly recursive code is a bad match for this kind of profiling?). I wonder if any of the developers of Julia might find this to be an interesting case study.</p>
<h4>Julia is Still Great for Writing High Performance Code</h4>
<p>In case you don't believe me that this poor performance is an exception rather than the rule with Julia, let me present you an example of where Julia shines. Here is how Julia lets us express our recursive Fibonacci benchmark program simply (without any explicit type annotations) while also running it blazingly quickly (at least an order of magnitude faster than <code>clox</code>).</p>

<h2>What's Next for JuLox</h2>
<p>I want to build two extensions to JuLox.</p>
<p>First, I want to build an odd kind of tree-to-tree compiler that translates a Lox syntax tree into a Julia syntax tree. This shouldn't be too hacky, since the structure of Julia programs can be manipulated in Julia itself (indeed, this is so-called homoiconicity is what powers Julia's macro system). My ambition is to make JuLox as fast or faster than <code>clox</code> for heavy workloads (e.g. to have the above Lox recursive Fibonacci benchmark run just as fast in JuLox as the native Julia code I presented after).</p>
<p>I also think such a tree-to-tree compiler is an interesting paradigm in its own right, since it sits between a traditional transpiler paradigm (in which we aim to spit out the source code of a high-level language that must go through tokenization and parsing again, making debugging and error handling trickier) and the paradigm of compiling to a VM bytecode built originally for another language (e.g. how Scala targets the JVM, or how Elixir targets the Erlang VM). Since Julia IR lowers straight into LLVM IR with no VM, this approach is perhaps closer to the second paradigm than the first, but it feels substantially higher level.</p>
<p>The second I'd like to build is a <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/extensibility/language-server-protocol?view=vs-2022">language server protocol (LSP)</a> implementation for Lox. Thanks to JuLox's lossless tokenization and syntax trees, it should be possible to even build features like auto-formatting on top of JuLox's tokenization, parsing, and semantic analysis. And since Julia has its own LSP implementation, it might be possible to borrow much of the HTTP server boilerplate and focus mostly on the Lox parts.</p>
<h2>Getting JuLox</h2>
<p>If for some reason this post has left you yearning to dive even deeper into JuLox, you will be pleased to learn that JuLox is available on GitHub as <a href="https://github.com/lukemerrick/JuLox.jl">JuLox.jl</a>, an MIT-licensed Julia package with a lightweight CLI built in. So if you are so inclined, take a peak, give it a test drive, or borrow some of its code for your own project!</p></div>

				<div class="text">Hey HN!
<p>I'm Gabriel, CEO and co-founder of Meticulous.</p><p>Our mission is to radically accelerate the pace of software development for every company in the world. We're starting with a tool to catch UI bugs in web applications with zero-effort from developers.</p>
<p>How it works: Insert a single line of JavaScript onto your site, and we record thousands of real user sessions. We then replay these sessions on head and base commits of PRs, take screenshots at key points, and diff those screenshots to catch visual regressions before they hit production. We employ novel techniques to eliminate flakes. You can watch a 60-second demo at [meticulous.ai](<a href="http://meticulous.ai/">http://meticulous.ai/</a>).</p>
<p>We are a London-based YC company. Our engineering team previously worked at Dropbox, Opendoor, Palantir and Google, and have previously led 100+ engineer organizations at these companies. We raised $4m and are backed by some of the best founders and technical leaders in Silicon Valley, including Guillermo Rauch (founder Vercel, author next.js), Jason Warner (CTO GitHub), Scott Belsky (CPO Adobe), Calvin French-Owen (founder Segment), Jared Friedman (YC partner and former CTO of Scribd) and a bunch of other incredible folks.</p>
<p>Catching visual regressions is just the start. There is an entire category of products to build on top of replay. This ranges from catching exceptions to revealing the performance impact of frontend code.</p>
<p>We want to change the way the world develops software, and influence software approaches for decades to come.</p>
<p>We are seeding a London office and hiring an onsite founding engineer to join our team of four. We sponsor visas.</p>
<p>You will have autonomy in building out this technology, but here are a few problems you might work on:</p>
<p>- Build a distributed system to concurrently replay thousands of sessions, such that a developer gets a result in seconds.</p>
<p>- Speed up the replay of sessions in a way that retains determinism.</p>
<p>- Derive algorithms to detect sessions that cover differing code paths and edge cases, and ignore sessions that are too similar.</p>
<p>- Help build out a team of world-class, highly collaborative, software engineers.</p>
<p>As founding engineer, you get to shape the company, and build the culture and technology from the ground up.</p>
<p>What we look for:</p>
<p>In a sentence: Technically brilliant, delightful to work with, combined with a self-awareness and strong desire to improve. We also want to make sure everyone is highly supportive of each other; we win as a team.</p>
<p>We're currently only looking to bring on folks with senior level skill sets and 5+ years of industry experience. You should have strong web fundamentals and a deep love for software engineering. Maybe you enjoy programming books like Clean Code, Designing Data Intensive Applications, Pragmatic Programmer etc. or enjoy hacking on interesting side projects. You value transparency and candid feedback, and are motivated by a strong desire to become the best engineer you can be.</p>
<p>You can read about our values here <a href="https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e74856af02da2e59c9f64d" rel="nofollow">https://ruby-wish-a8f.notion.site/Mission-Values-979c32ec58e...</a></p>
<p>You will be given the space and time to up-level yourself as an engineer in terms of conferences, reading, or whatever you think will be most valuable. We will also set you up with mentorship, if you desire it, from top engineering leaders (folks running 100-engineer organizations at the world's leading tech companies).</p>
<p>You‚Äôll get to work alongside some of the best engineers there are, break new ground solving truly novel CS problems and deliver something that transforms how software is built.</p>
<p>If this sounds interesting, please reach out to me at gabe [at] meticulous [dot] ai with ‚ÄúHN‚Äù in the subject line and 2-3 sentences about what you find interesting about Meticulous and your resume/LinkedIn/GitHub.</p></div>

<h2 data-sanitized-id="preface">Preface</h2>
<p>Back in late April of 2020, the source code of CSGO and TF2 were leaked. Since then, I‚Äôve been working with the CSGO source code personally on a project that I call Kisak-Strike: Gentoo Offensive.</p>
<p>The Goal of Kisak-Strike is 100% open source CS:GO from the 2017-era for perservation, enthusiast use, and long term maintenance.</p>
<p>This blog post tells a rough historical story of the project up to today - in chronological order.</p>
<h2 data-sanitized-id="the-leak">The Leak</h2>
<p><em>(Some may know about this part already, and can safely skip to the next section)</em></p>
<p>April 22nd, 2020 - Rumor of a CSGO source code leak spreads around various groups. At first this was hard to believe, but as the day progressed, a mega.nz link materialized and it was obviously true.</p>
<p>The leaks come from a Valve fanatic youtuber known as the Valve News Network(VNN). I don‚Äôt really care for his videos much, but apparently his relationship with Valve is closer than he portrays in his videos. VNN and his group of goons had gotten buddy-buddy enough with Valve to secure a Source Engine Partner relationship, something quite rare and normally only given to professional developers for games like: Titanfall, Insurgency, Vampire: The Masquerade, and a few others.</p>
<p>Anyone can use the Source Engine 2013 SDK, but it only contains headers for precompiled libraries. It isn‚Äôt possible (without binary hacks) to modify the behavior/code of the engine because the Source Code is not included. A Partner relationship is more advanced and grants access to the Source Engine Source.</p>
<p>The partner build isn‚Äôt complete however. Valve thought that leaks were a possibility so they made sure to cut out sensitive bits of information. There are also 3rd party libraries, like Scaleform Flash UI, where Valve cannot give out the Source Code and instead give out precompiled-blobs.</p>
<h2 data-sanitized-id="opening-the-leak">Opening the Leak</h2>
<p>What exactly did we get in the leak? Let‚Äôs see‚Ä¶ <img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/mega_archive.png" alt="mega-archive"></p>
<p>There‚Äôs 2 folders to focus on - (which are initially contained in full.7z)</p>
<p><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">cstrike15_src</code> - CSGO</p>
<p><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">hl2_src</code> - TF2</p>
<p>There‚Äôs also a concept game here called FStop. Can‚Äôt say I was too interested in it, but while eyeballing it again for this post, I noticed it has some deferred rendering stuff in it that could be cool.</p>
<p>There‚Äôs some boring chat logs and a Dota Merchandise concept, and lastly a note from the leaker himself.</p>
<div readability="34" data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<div readability="13" data-sanitized-class="highlight">
<pre data-sanitized-class="highlight"><code>full.zip is the entire Counter Strike: Global Offensive source code as of Operation Hydra and the TF2 source code as of Jungle Inferno.
These were willingly held onto by a select few of people, (VNN, etc) and kept in a very small circle. It was some kind of medium for them to jerk off about having secret shit
Some weird schizoid managed to grab both these codebases during his work on some 900th attempt of a HL2 VR project and his major goal was to have this circle leak it to the public and fly to his girlfriends house (also involved in the valve community) and kill himself and her. Absolutely fucking insane, and it's something to have a beer over and laugh about with your source modding friends
Ended up getting arrested after she fleed and cops had been called. 
A lot of interesting knowledge can be gained from these two codebases alone and a lot of resourceful information can come of it. Go wild!

<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/csgo_files.png" alt="csgo-files"></p>
<p>For Windows users, this part was probably pretty easy, there‚Äôs a .bat file to make it nice and easy to import into Visual Studio. But unfortunately for Linux gamers like myself, things were a bit rigged.</p>
<p>First off, let‚Äôs check out CreateSolution.bat</p>
<div readability="31" data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<div readability="7" data-sanitized-class="highlight">
<pre data-sanitized-class="highlight"><code>devtools\bin\vpc.exe /csgo +csgo_partner /mksln csgo_partner.sln

</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>This is where the first ‚Äúvillain‚Äù of the story is encountered.</p>
<p><a href="https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Valve_Project_Creator">VPC</a>, the Valve Project Creator, is what‚Äôs used to build this project. Basically, this is a custom build-system made by Valve in the Early 2000s back before CMake or Meson were popular. It has a high-level syntax that is translated into makefiles for each supported platform.</p>
<p>On Windows, this means it will create Visual Studio .vcproj files for you.</p>
<p>However on Linux, it will create a makefile for each project in their respective folders, and a master makefile <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">csgo_partner.mak</code> in the main directory.</p>
<p><strong>As of this post, I count 73 build targets. A target is a static library, dynamic library, or executable file.</strong></p>
<p>First, I had to recreate the hardcoded build tools path.</p>
<figure readability="3" data-sanitized-class="highlight"><pre><code data-lang="cpp" data-sanitized-class="language-cpp"><span data-sanitized-class="cm">/** I created a full guide back when the leak was new and exiting (https://gist.github.com/LWSS/9d2cd3205d197545d64fd27ee897fd53) that I will be referring to. **/</span></code></pre></figure><div readability="32" data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<div readability="9" data-sanitized-class="highlight">
<pre data-sanitized-class="highlight"><code>mkdir -p /valve/bin64/
cd /valve/bin64/
ln -s $(which ar) ar
ln -s $(which gcc) gcc-4.6

#this part comes from cryptopp
mkdir -p /valve/steam-runtime/bin
cd /valve/steam-runtime/bin
ln -s $(which g++) g++
ln -s $(which gcc) gcc
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>The Valve Cookbook explicitly calls for GCC 4.6.3, I believe this is because of the CXX11 String ABI changes that happened that year, but can be reverted with a preprocessor definition <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_GLIBCXX_USE_CXX11_ABI=0</code>. I went ahead and put this in some VPC files so I wouldn‚Äôt have to bother setting up old GCC and patching it to work on today‚Äôs systems. (Which I actually did first, see the link above) <img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/vpc_cxx11_1.png" alt="vpc1"><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/vpc_cxx11_2.png" alt="vpc2"></p>
<p>Alright so after that, we have to manually build each one of the dependencies and put them in the <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/lib</code> folder. Valve devs did not bother adding them to VPC because they theoretically never need to be rebuilt.</p>
<p>The dependencies are located in <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/external</code> and <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/thirdparty</code> and include: libSDL2_mixer, libtcmalloc, cryptopp, libPNG, libz, and more! I‚Äôm not going to talk about them in detail because it‚Äôs pretty straight forward stuff, but if you want to see more read the gist linked above.</p>
<p>At this point we‚Äôre ready to build with VPC! Here‚Äôs the params I used.</p>
<div readability="31.5" data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<div readability="8" data-sanitized-class="highlight">
<pre data-sanitized-class="highlight"><code>./devtools/bin/vpc /csgo /f +csgo_partner /no_scaleform -dedicated_main -datamodel -stdshader_dbg -game_controls -movieobjects /mksln csgo_partner.sln /linux64
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>Then we just run <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">make</code> right? Well sure that would work but take over an hour, we need some threads but take a look here in the <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">csgo_partner.mak</code></p>
<figure readability="9" data-sanitized-class="highlight"><pre><code data-lang="bash" data-sanitized-class="language-bash"><span data-sanitized-class="c"># to control parallelism, set the MAKE_JOBS environment variable</span>

<p>However, this doesn‚Äôt work how you would expect it to. Remember earlier when I said that the project has about 73 targets(A target being a static library, dynamic library, or executable). The MAKE_JOBS variable controls how many targets are built at once, this means that if you do MAKE_JOBS=20, it will start building 20 targets with 1 thread.</p>
<p>This is bad for 2 reasons,</p>
<p>-1 Some of the targets are huge and take a long time, while most are medium-small. This means that the biggest targets will continue to build for 20 minutes while everything else is done.</p>
<p>-2 It doesn‚Äôt take dependencies into account, which means that you will require <strong>Multiple Build Sweeps</strong> to get everything compiled.</p>
<p>The full build was taking over 20 Minutes on my Threadripper 2950x, and I wasn‚Äôt satisfied with the workflow; This leads us into Act II‚Ä¶</p>

**/</span></code></pre></figure><p>CMake was the obvious choice for the new build system. I already knew it, it is the goto standard nowadays, and my favorite C++ editor, CLion, would gain superpowers once it was complete.</p>
<p>Now i‚Äôll show some example conversion from VPC-&gt;CMake.</p>
<p>One of the first ones I did was the ToGL project, don‚Äôt ask why, I just clicked somewhere and took off.</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/togl_vpc_header.png" alt="vpc_togl_header"></p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the start of the file, notice how variables are set with the <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$Macro</code> keyword, <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$include</code> statements are supported, and there is a <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$Configuration</code> section. Now let‚Äôs see the CMake Version‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/togl_cmake_header.png" alt="cmake_togl_header"></p>
<p>As you can see it‚Äôs pretty similar, with a little extra meat on the CMake version. Each CMake file will include some of the common things like CMAKE_MODULE_PATH to be more modular. Every target in the Kisak-Strike project can be built separately at any time.</p>
<p>Now let‚Äôs look at the source files.</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/togl_vpc.png" alt="vpc_togl"></p>
<p>This target is pretty simple, there‚Äôs only a handful of .cpp files. One of the things you‚Äôll notice are the <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">[$VARIABLE]</code> blocks at the end of some lines. These are VPC if-statements and the line is only included if that variable is set.</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/togl_cmake_sources.png" alt="cmake_togl_sources"></p>
<p>On the CMake side, it‚Äôs pretty similar, but the if-statements are more obvious. One thing to note is that I didn‚Äôt bother adding header files to the target sources. I‚Äôve seen this before in similar CMake projects(dhewm3, RBDoom3BFG) and the only reason to add it is if you would want them to show up in the Headers section of Visual Studio when importing a project. Visual Studio CMake support is slowly getting better, so soon I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll be needed at all.</p>
<p>Lastly there is a link-section at the bottom of the VPC <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$Project</code> section.</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/togl_vpc_link.png" alt="vpc_togl_link"></p>
<p>This project links to tier2 and mathlib as you can see.</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/togl_cmake_link.png" alt="cmake_togl_link"></p>
<p>Same on CMake, but you might notice the extra libvstdlib. There‚Äôs actually 4 hidden links deep within the bowels of VPC that get added to every project. I‚Äôve dubbed these the ‚ÄúStinky linkies‚Äù they are libtier0, tier1, interfaces, and vstdlib. I have them in the CMake base project but since this was the first one it looks like I added it manually and it can be safely removed.</p>
<p>Speaking of the CMake Base project, they are located in the <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/cmake</code> folder of Kisak-Strike and only the linux version is implemented.</p>
<p>All in all it took me about 2 months to finish the port to CMake, I ported the dependencies to CMake and even got things like the protobufs relying the on custom build output of the protoc compiler project.</p>

<p>There is lots of room for improvement here too, we aren‚Äôt even using ccache (like VPC does) nor are we using precompiled headers.</p>
<h4 data-sanitized-id="side-adventure">Side Adventure</h4>
<p>Recently I found a blog post by a Linux Valve developer telling about his compile times. (And no I don‚Äôt stalk Valve employees, it was linked in the VoGL wiki)</p>
<p>Here is the <a href="https://linux-debugger-bits.blogspot.com/2014/09/glibtop-this-machine-has-56-cpus-32-are.html">post</a> written by a Mr. Mike Sartain</p>

I tend to muck with the lower level libraries which meant I was spending quite a bit of my day waiting for these builds to finish.

TF2 dedicated server has:
 - 1347 cpp files
 - 13 DSOs (with 13 .dbg files)
 - 12 static libraries

<p>The CMake version rocks, and I would like to add that Kisak-Strike compiles way more code than the VPC version. How much more? Well most of the dependencies + lots of extra <em>stuff</em> that was not included in the CSGO partner repo.</p>

<p>Why don‚Äôt we take a peek at another function in this class‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/recoilonland.png" alt="recoilonland"></p>
<p>That part with <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetPlayerOwner()</code> looks like what we want, and look here, it has a dynamic_cast.</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/getplayerowner.png" alt="recoilonland"></p>
<p>Alright let‚Äôs move to the next part‚Ä¶ (Zoom In)</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/recoilida2.png" alt="recoilida2"></p>
<p>At the top you‚Äôll see our dynamic_cast code and then a quick if-statement block to check if null, then return. After this the code loads up <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C_BaseEntity::m_nPredictionRandomSeed</code> into a variable. We can access this easily with <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">GetPredictionRandomSeed()</code> here:</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/predseed.png" alt="oredseed"></p>
<p>After this, the code checks <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weapon_legacy_recoiltable</code> to see if it‚Äôs set. As an OG CSGO player, I happened to already know that this was related to the nospread patch where the spread seeds got changed to be server-sided. It will either call <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CCSWeaponInfo::GetRecoilOffsets()</code> or <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g_WeaponRecoilData.GetRecoilOffsets()</code> depending on its state. We have access to both of these functions already and in order to make sure we get it right, we can just take a look at them and see which one is not legacy.</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/ccsweaponinfo_getrecoiloffsets.png" alt="ccsweaponinfo_getrecoiloffsets"></p>
<p>Alright so according to this comment, this one is obsolete and will be used if <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">weapon_legacy_recoiltable</code> is set to 1.</p>
<p>We have one more small chunk to look at‚Ä¶</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/recoilkickback.png" alt="kickback"></p>
<p>Which is pretty easy to read, just apply the resulting recoil to the Player Owner we got earlier.</p>
<p>The final code looks like this:</p>

You‚Äôll also notice the <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//lwss</code> and <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">//lwss end</code>, this is something I picked up from one of my idTech friends. It‚Äôs a standard procedure to comment your changes with these blocks as a partner, so that when you ask for engine-support they can tell what changes you‚Äôve made. I think it‚Äôs a little outdated with modern VCS but it‚Äôs kinda comfy and I thought it was appropriate for this project.</p>
<p>So that was one example of restoring code, as you can see the Debug bins are a valuable tool. They also happen to be from around the exact time this repo is from. Another good resource is the accompanying TF2 leak, it seems to be more complete than the CS:GO version, and we will refer to it later in this post.</p>
<p>This was done a few more times to fully restore the weapons, make loadouts work(especially on the bots), and other various things.</p>
<h2 data-sanitized-id="building-csgo---act-iv-unsustainable-ui">Building CSGO - Act IV: Unsustainable UI</h2>
<p>Replacing the Scaleform UI was the next big task on my Agenda.</p>
<p>Keeping it was out of the question due to it being incomplete, proprietary, and laggy. I thought about hacking Panorama UI in, which would be pretty amusing, however it‚Äôs closed source and doesn‚Äôt fit the theme of the project. I also thought about finishing the VGUI. I already knew that the codebase for VGUI was pretty bad after a previous attempt at doing a VGUI menu for another project, but after seeing it in more detail, I opted out!</p>
<p>I looked around a bit for some alternatives:</p>
<ul><li>Good ole‚Äô ImGUI - not customizable enough, only good for settings menus tbh.</li>
<li>FlatUI - Abandoned, bloated, made by google</li>
<li>Chromium Embedded - LAG</li>
<li>EAWebkit - LAG</li>
<li>Coherent Hummingbird(Diabotical) - Closed source, expensive, lame</li>
</ul><p>I finally found the absolute perfect library for the job, and it‚Äôs called RmlUI.</p>
<h4 data-sanitized-id="rmlui">RmlUI</h4>
<p><a href="https://github.com/mikke89/RmlUi">RmlUI</a>, a fork of the abandoned libRocket, is an up-and-coming UI library. It uses custom trimmed-down versions of HTML and CSS along with a custom engine that is not WebKit-based. It does not include any scripting languages by default (Which I like), however Lua support can be enabled.</p>
<p>The library is very well abstracted and the Documentation covers everything you need to know to implement the required interfaces(Rendering/System/Filesystem/etc). In fact after testing out the included demo, I immediately started implementing the library into the game and didn‚Äôt run into any major problems except for OpenGL state mismatches that were my fault.</p>
<h4 data-sanitized-id="integrating-rmlui">Integrating RmlUI</h4>
<p>I wanted to do a proper integration of the library, and in order to do this I would have to match or exceed the quality of the Scaleform code.</p>
<p>Here is the layout of RmlUI in the KisakStrike code base:</p>
<ul><li>ADDITIONAL CMAKE FLAG -DUSE_ROCKETUI=1</li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/game/client/cstrike15/RocketUI/*</code>
<ul><li>Here is the cpp code for all of the CSGO custom elements. Each element will load a corresponding <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">.rml</code> file using the RocketUI interface.</li>
<li>Note that the RocketUI system consists of 2 Contexts, one for the Main Menu and another for In-Game. Naming Scheme RkHud loads to the in-game context and RkMenu to the Main Menu, an RkPanel can be loaded in either.</li>
<li>Rocket HUD elements are registered with <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DECLARE_HUDELEMENT</code> and derive from <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CHudElement</code>. This means that they are automatically called/registered with the game engine.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/public/rocketui/rocketui.h</code>
<ul><li>The <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/public</code> folder is where you will find headers for interfaces, files in here are generally safe to include and mostly contain pure interfaces and predeclarations. The RocketUI Interface is here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/rocketui/*</code>
<ul><li>This is a custom CTier3AppSystem implementation of the RocketUI interface. This is a new target that builds into a <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rocketui.so</code> that will be loaded by the game on launch and jacked in via the <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">interface</code> system.</li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rocketuiimpl.cpp</code> is the Main implementation for the interface Init/Connect/Disconnect.</li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rocketrenderGL.cpp</code> is an OpenGL Rendering implementation. Ideally we would use the ToGL system, but I wanted to get something working first and this project is aimed to be Linux-Only.</li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rocketfilesystem.cpp</code> File system chroot‚Äôd to the <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${GAMEDIR}/csgo/rocketui/*</code> area in the game folders AND/OR pak files via the regular filesystem interface.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">${GAMEDIR}/csgo/rocketui/*</code>
<ul><li>A New folder in the game directory that contains our new UI Layout and Style files, along with images, fonts, and templates.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul><p>Modifications made to the Existing Codebase:</p>
<ul><li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/public/interfaces/interfaces.h</code>
<ul><li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DECLARE_TIER3_INTERFACE</code> for RocketUI</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/engine/host.cpp</code> - <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_Host_RunFrame</code>
<ul><li>Calling into RocketUI on new frame. Used to update RocketUI and set the client realtime.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/engine/keys.cpp</code> - <em>various</em>
<ul><li>Input hook that goes to <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RocketUI::HandleInputEvent()</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/engine/sys_dll2.cpp</code> - <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CEngineAPI::Connect</code>
<ul><li>Addition of RocketUI Interface factory and setting value of <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g_pRocketUI</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/engine/sys_mainwind.cpp</code> - <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">CGame::DispatchInputEvent()</code>
<ul><li>Copy a Scaleform hack here to stop Input hook while vgui console is open.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/engine/view.cpp</code> - `V_RenderVGuiOnly_NoSwap()
<ul><li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RenderRocketMenu()</code> is called here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/game/client/c_playerresource.cpp</code> - <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">C_PlayerResource constructor and destructor</code>
<ul><li>Call <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">g_pRocketUI-&gt;AddDeviceDependentObject()</code> on construction of C_PlayerResource and remove it on Destruction. This registers RocketUI to receive callbacks when the rendering device is updated.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/game/client/viewrender.cpp</code> - <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RenderView()</code>
<ul><li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">RenderRocketHUD()</code> is called here.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/materialsystem/cmatqueuedrendercontext.h</code>
<ul><li>Add <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">DEFINE_QUEUED_CALL</code>‚Äôs for RocketUI. This is needed for <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">mat_queue_mode</code> which means that the draw commands are stacked up and done on another thread. 99% of the time this is enabled because it gives 40-50% more FPS.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Various others.</li>
</ul><p>Some other things to Note:</p>
<ul><li>Enabled <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">WITH_OVERLAY_CURSOR_VISIBILITY_WORKAROUND</code> to get the system mouse cursor to stop flashing. (I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôve noticed this if you played CSGO back when it had Scaleform and I would bet money that Valve enabled this in Panorama)</li>
<li>Splitscreen slots are not implemented, but keep in mind they aren‚Äôt implemented in Panorama either.</li>
<li>Uses Raw OpenGL commands currently.</li>
</ul><p>I had someone ask me how I implemented it and thought I would write up a decent overview for them to see, it also helps get an idea of how the engine hooks up to RocketUI exactly. For more information, you can see this <a href="https://github.com/SwagSoftware/Kisak-Strike/commit/92999771064cf1bdcc0a718dfdf255a092203913">commit</a>.</p>
<h4 data-sanitized-id="showcase">Showcase</h4>
<p>What I wanted from the UI was something that was basic, fast, and did the job. There‚Äôs always room for improvement after the functionality is there, and I designed the UI to be highly customizable by the end-user.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs a short video showing what it looks like:</p>
<video width="900" height="600" controls="controls" muted preload="none"><source src="https://lwss.github.io/videos/rocketuiShowcaseShort.mp4" type="video/mp4"> Your browser does not support the video tag.</source></video><p>Everything is hooked up and working; very lightweight, performance impact is only about 1%.</p>
<p>This is the biggest original chunk of code in the KisakStrike codebase, but something that needed to be done seeing as the ScaleformUI was neutered and VGUI was never finished.</p>
<h2 data-sanitized-id="building-csgo---act-v-chasing-the-dream">Building CSGO - Act V: Chasing the Dream</h2>
<p>This Act will be our crescendo, the amount of pure unbridled autism in this section is massive. A Project months in the making, this is It, this final part truly took the most amount time and work, and I will try and show how.</p>
<p>First, let me state the Absolute objective for this project when I started it.</p>
<div readability="32.5" data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">
<div readability="10" data-sanitized-class="highlight">
<pre data-sanitized-class="highlight"><code>A Fully Open-Source CSGO for Linux, with no blobs, 
something able to be preserved by the users forever 
on any architecture or platform. 
</code></pre></div>
</div>
<p>If we got nuked tomorrow, and Steam went down, anyone could have CSGO up and running in the Bunker LAN by next week. Years later when us smoothskins are rockin‚Äô Power9 Rigs, we would also have the ability to recompile and port the game.</p>
<h4 data-sanitized-id="evil-blobs">Evil Blobs</h4>
<p>Anything Closed-Source is automatically evil. After making sure I had all our ducks in a row, these were the remaining closed-source blobs for the game.</p>
<ul><li>libphonon3d.so ( HRTF Audio )</li>
<li>vphysics_client.so ( All Physics, Raytraces )</li>
<li>gcsdk_client.a ( Game Coordinator )</li>
<li>steamdatagramlib_client.a ( SDR Relays )</li>
</ul><h3 data-sanitized-id="hrtf-audio">HRTF Audio</h3>
<p>Let‚Äôs start with an easy one, HRTF audio was added to game in a later patch. No offense, but I never really liked it, thought it sounded like I was underwater and could use more tuning.</p>
<p>I added #ifdef‚Äôs to several of the audio engine code files and enabled this as an optional build step ( <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-DUSE_VALVE_HRTF</code> ).</p>
<p>In the future I would like to explore some of the new OpenAL 3D audio extensions and see how well they work.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-id="steam-datagram-lib">Steam Datagram lib</h3>
<p>Another easy one.</p>
<p>SDR Relays are only used to connect to Valve Matchmaking Servers. I want this project to have the best chance of staying publicly available, so I decided it was out of scope.</p>
<p>Added more #ifdef‚Äôs and removed the functionality.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-id="gc-sdk">GC SDK</h3>
<p>Here‚Äôs where things get interesting‚Ä¶ Do you remember when I said that the TF2 leak had more content than the CSGO one?</p>
<p>The TF2 leak actually has this part, but of course it wasn‚Äôt a straight paste job‚Ä¶</p>
<ul><li>CSGO specific stuff missing of course, and the initialization depended on that.</li>
<li>There were updates to the GCSDK since TF2, inconsistencies regarding SOID_t, CSteamID, etc needed to be resolved.</li>
</ul><p>New Files</p>
<ul><li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/game/shared/gc_clientsystem.cpp/.h</code>
<ul><li>Basic GC connection. Generic baseline communcation. Generic Message Handlers</li>
</ul></li>
<li><code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/game/client/cstrike15/cs_gc_client.cpp/.h</code>
<ul><li>CSGO specific messages. Message Handlers.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Protobufs were updated to the retail version to ensure they worked properly.</li>
</ul><p>The <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/gcsdk</code> and <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/public/gcsdk</code> folder is from TF2. Note that <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/gcsdk_original</code> and <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/public/gcsdk_original</code> are the original ones that came with CSGO that were incomplete.</p>
<p>This component was actually very much needed for the Dedicated server to work because the blob that we got in the leak was not compiled with <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-DDEDICATED</code> so some of the code in <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/tier0/threadtools</code> was different. Originally hacks were made in this area to get the dedicated to work, but they have since been removed.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what it looks like when logging in:</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/kisak_gc_login.png" alt="gclogin"></p>
<p>The Send/Recv msg‚Äôs are a little touch that I did, they are Dota2-style. Right now there is just a simple handler for the Matchmaking Hello that shows some of your account info.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-id="physics">Physics</h3>
<p>The best was saved for last.</p>
<p>The physics engine was removed from the CSGO leak, after a brief look in the TF2 leak it appeared to be there. <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/vphysics</code> was there, it looked complete, and was the same interface version as the CSGO vphysics.</p>
<p>However, it relies on a folder called <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/ivp</code> that was absent from both leaks.</p>
<p>At the time, I had no idea what IVP stood for. After some searching I discovered it stood for <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Ipion Virtual Physics</code> and was a German middleware from around 1999 that later went out of business. It‚Äôs hard to find information on them, but it seems they were absorbed by their competitor Havok in the early 2000‚Äôs and no longer exist.</p>
<p>IVP was not anywhere online and seemed to be lost forever to the sands of time. Just when I thought all hope was lost, I thought of one more place to look‚Ä¶ The infamous HL2 beta leak from 2003. I looked online for this leak and didn‚Äôt find it anywhere ( <em>While writing this article of course it‚Äôs the 1st result that leads to vcc.wiki, go figure</em> ). I knew that I had downloaded it somewhere and started looking through old hard drives‚Ä¶ After about an hour, I found it on my old 2016 drive, but did it have the <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">/ivp</code> folder? Bingo, it did!</p>
<h5 data-sanitized-id="20th-century-abomination">20th Century Abomination</h5>
<p>After finally finding the ancient magicks from 1999, Germany, I was ready to paste it into KisakStrike and have it work. But, it wasn‚Äôt even close to functioning.</p>
<p>This code is early C++, written by German Physicists in half-german, half-english, hard-coded to be 32-bit. There was int-pointer arithmetic scattered throughout the entire thing that would make it impossible to work on 64-bit.</p>
<p>Now of course these guys are a lot smarter than me, and I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some solid mathematics in this code, but take a look at some of this:</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/ivp_krautspeak.png" alt="ivp_kraut"></p>
<p>For some reason they really loved using the thisptr to get back to an array address.</p>

<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/lwsshack3.png" alt="lwsshack3"></p>
<p>But it looks like I wasn‚Äôt the only one hack‚Äôin</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/ivphacks.png" alt="ivphacks"></p>
<p>Here‚Äôs the amount of <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">lwss</code>‚Äôs I added to the code altogether.</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/lwss%20total.png" alt="lwsstotal"></p>
<p>The code is in a super rough state, but I‚Äôve duct-taped it enough so that it works.</p>
<h5 data-sanitized-id="raggedy-ragdolls">Raggedy Ragdolls</h5>
<p>One area I had some trouble in was the Ragdolls, here‚Äôs a blooper segment‚Ä¶</p>
<p>After getting it working, here‚Äôs the initial result.</p>

The file is only about 210 lines, but don‚Äôt ask me why it fails on O2 and not on O1!</p>

This was actually a bug that I introduced while upgrading the code. In CSGO there is a feature where the ragdoll gravity can be set different from the rest of the physics. This is called <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">SetAlternateGravity()</code>, not the best name fellas, but I needed to have something there for the interface and here‚Äôs what I had.</p>
<p><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://lwss.github.io/images/SetAlternateGravity.png" alt="setaltgrav"></p>
<p>I messed up the Axis‚Äôs of course, but I ended up removing this code completely instead of setting the game‚Äôs gravity to the cl_ragdoll_gravity ( something silly in the first place ).</p>
<p>Take #3:</p>

<p>The Open Source Physics rebuild - known as Kisak-Physics does not implement the following:</p>
<ul><li>Ragdoll-Specific Gravity</li>
<li>Cars</li>
<li>Prediction (effects unknown!)</li>
</ul><p>It‚Äôs in a decent state now, but is an optional build-step due to not being perfect. Use <code data-sanitized-class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">-DUSE_KISAK_PHYSICS</code> to enable.</p>

<p>I want to discuss some of the constraints I have put on this project.</p>
<ol><li>Kisak-Strike is Linux-Only.
<ul><li>I don‚Äôt care about Windows/Mac users, they both have the ability to come to Linux for free.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kisak-Strike does not connect to Matchmaking
<ul><li>This doesn‚Äôt seem appropriate. In the future, I might add community server connectivity. Currently, you will need to connect to a dedicated kisak-strike server.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Kisak-Strike has no skins
<ul><li>Something Valve is sensitive about</li>
</ul></li>
</ol><p>Kisak-Strike does not want to compete with the mainline game. Instead we want to take the game our own direction and have complete modding freedom over the code.</p>

</nav><p>Now, I've been doing projects with Raspberry Pi's since the first version, and I only recently found out about a Linux feature that allows you to connect to the Pi directly over USB: it's called <strong>USB gadget mode</strong>. With "gadget mode" enabled, we don't need to configure the WiFi network or connect any peripheral devices, we simply connect the Pi to our computer with a USB cable, and now we've got SSH access.</p>
<p>In this guide, I'll show you how enable gadget mode and connect to your Pi via USB.</p>
<p><em>Note: I believe this feature was initially enabled for the Pi Zero, and it does not work on earlier versions of the Pi. I have, however, tested with the Raspberry Pi 4, and it works as long as you connect via the USB-C connector.</em></p>

				<div class="text"><h6>Shyam Krishnaswamy, Thomas Legris, Tomasz Jonak &amp; Michal Rostecki</h6>

<p>Hello, <a href="https://deepfence.io/">Deepfence</a> community! We have some exciting news to share. We are thrilled to announce that <a href="https://github.com/deepfence/ebpfguard">eBPFGuard</a>, our groundbreaking open-source Rust library, is becoming an integral part of our cutting-edge commercial solution for threat detection and mitigation, <a href="https://www.deepfence.io/threatstryker">ThreatStryker</a>!</p>
<p>What does this mean for you? In a cybersecurity landscape that's becoming increasingly complex and sophisticated, you need a solution that is equally advanced and robust. That's where eBPFGuard steps in. By integrating eBPFGuard into ThreatStryker, we're taking a giant leap forward in our exploitation detection capabilities. This dynamic duo will provide alerts and make mitigation decisions, applying the most suitable solutions directly at the host kernel level, right where you need it the most.</p>
<p>‚Äç<a href="https://github.com/deepfence/ebpfguard">eBPFGuard</a> is a product of our passion for securing digital landscapes. If you want to read more about how we utilize eBPF more generally within our security tools, read our blog post, ‚Äú<a href="https://www.deepfence.io/blog/aya-your-trusty-ebpf-companion">Aya: your tRusty eBPF Companion</a>.‚Äù Developed by the brilliant minds at Deepfence, it protects applications from exploitation by selectively blocking specific kernel function calls based on user-defined policies. The best part? It does this without having you deal with the kernel directly, reducing complexity while maximizing efficiency.</p>
<p>But there's more! <a href="https://github.com/deepfence/ebpfguard">eBPFGuard also comes packed with impressive features designed to make your life easier, like managing the lifecycle of eBPF programs, ensuring kernel version independence, and alerting you with contextual data whenever a policy is enforced</a>. One of the standout features of eBPFGuard is its utilization of eBPF programs attached to LSM hooks. This feature allows you to create custom policies using code, thereby significantly reducing your attack surface. Moreover, we have carefully designed eBPFGuard to work across a wide range of scenarios, from single-machine enforcement to enforcement in pods on the same cluster node. Let‚Äôs dig into two of these powerful features quickly. </p>
<h2>Execution Control: Harnessing LSM Hook Points with eBPFGuard</h2>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Security_Modules">Linux Security Modules (LSM) framework</a> is a powerful tool that empowers developers to sculpt the security logic operating on the Linux kernel. For a comprehensive understanding of this framework, feel free to <a href="https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/security/lsm.html">delve into the Linux kernel documentation for LSM</a>.</p>
<p>In essence, the Linux kernel reaches out to specific LSM hooks to make a call on whether or not to continue with a given code execution. These hooks function as decision-making checkpoints, receiving a range of arguments that provide the context required for implementing informed policy decisions. The details of these arguments are neatly outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/torvalds/linux/blob/master/include/linux/lsm_hook_defs.h">lsm_hook_defs.h</a> header.</p>
<h2>Policy Decisions Through eBPF Hook Programs</h2>
<p>The game changed with Linux 5.7 when the kernel began allowing eBPF objects to be tethered to LSM hook points. This change uncorked the potential to craft custom policies using code. eBPFGuard capitalizes on this capability by shaping and attaching the hooks to the LSM hook points as dictated by user requirements. Once this setup is complete, users can sculpt policies that will be brought to bear during hook execution.</p>
<p>As it stands, eBPFGuard paves the way for users to append policies to a suite of hooks:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>file_open - Giving you the power to limit access to any file you choose.</li>
<li>sb_mount/sb_remount/sb_umount - Providing control over operations concerning filesystem management.</li>
<li>task_fix_setuid - Offering the ability to constrain changes to user identity, for instance, preventing a shift to root.</li>
<li>socket_bind - Enabling you to regulate the ports that applications can tap into.</li>
<li>socket_connect - Allowing you to control outbound connections.</li>
</ul><p>So, step into a new world of security control with eBPFGuard, harnessing the power of LSM hook points to protect your system in a more granular and customized way.</p>
<p>But don‚Äôt just take our word for it! <a href="https://github.com/deepfence/ebpfguard-blog-example">We have a hands-on demo ready for you to explore</a>. In this demo, we walk you through the process of setting up a policy to block attackers from setting up an SSH server on a compromised machine.</p>
<h2>Demo</h2>
<figure data-sanitized-class="w-richtext-align-center w-richtext-figure-type-image"><div><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://assets.website-files.com/63eaa07bbe3702195bb003fd/645d6277b4df06ac535a6b6a_image1.gif" loading="lazy" alt></div>
</figure><p>In this demonstration, both the <a href="https://github.com/deepfence/ebpfguard">eBPFGuard</a> application and its enforcement mechanisms run on the same local machine. We are fully cognizant of the fact that our customers have a spectrum of deployment models to consider. For instance, when an application is deployed across a suite of containers managed by orchestration platforms like Docker or Kubernetes, single-machine enforcement might not be sufficient.</p>
<p>The beauty of eBPFGuard is that since the hooks operate at the kernel level, it can perform policy matching and enforcement on all processes managed by a single kernel instance. This enables a broad scope of enforcement that transcends individual machines or containers. We've put eBPFGuard to the test and confirmed its effectiveness in various scenarios:</p>
<ul role="list"><li>eBPFGuard running on a host machine, performing matching and enforcement on both the host and deployed containers</li>
<li>eBPFGuard housed within a container on a host, conducting matching and enforcement on other containers on the same host, and the host itself</li>
<li>eBPFGuard deployed as a Kubernetes DaemonSet, with enforcement carried out in pods on the same cluster node</li>
</ul><h2>Code Breakdown</h2>
<p>Now, let's take a step-by-step walk through <a href="https://github.com/deepfence/ebpfguard-blog-example">the key components of the demonstration source code</a> and delve into the eBPFGuard APIs. We'll be examining slightly simplified versions of the samples compared to the executed demo code for clarity.</p>
<p>It's important to note that all example code should be viewed as if encapsulated within the following block.</p>

<p>eBPFGuard include line has to be present in Cargo.toml. The following snippet contains all dependencies utilized by our example code.</p>

<p>First, we need a top level object called PolicyManager. It will let us pick hook points we want to attach to.</p>

<p>Example is centered around blocking processes from listening on port 22. Processes usually do this by binding to some socket. We can use socket_bind hook to intercept and limit this operation.</p>

<p>After this operation we have an object representing a hook attached to socket_bind call. It is not enforcing any policies for now. Default action for hooks is to allow all calls.</p>
<p>Before we define any policies for this hook, we should set up alerts channel. It is a way for the hook to send us information about denied bind calls.</p>

<p>Policies are hook scoped, so are notifications. Granularity of policy definition is dependent on hook point. In case of bind we can currently scope ourselves to either all processes or process executing a particular binary via PolicySubject and sets of layer 4 protocol ports via allow and deny lists.</p>
<p>Demo policy applies to all processes and allows all ports but 22.</p>

<p>Finally we can add a defined policy to socket_bind hook.</p>

<p>When add_policy call succeeds, the socket_bind hook starts enforcing our policy. At this point we can start listening for alerts.</p>

<p>‚Äç<sup>‚Äç</sup>Putting this all together:</p>

<p>‚Äç</p>
<h2>Roadmap and Looking Ahead</h2>
<p>eBPFGuard is in early stages of development and we are just starting. We have a roadmap chalked out for eBPFGuard with exciting features and improvements on the horizon, including support for additional hooks, improved per-hook policy filtering granularity, and enhanced API documentation.</p>
<p>‚Äç<a href="https://github.com/deepfence/ebpfguard">eBPFGuard</a> is a testament to Deepfence's commitment to staying ahead of the curve in the cybersecurity world. We believe it will be a significant asset in your defense arsenal, helping you combat and mitigate threats like never before.</p>

<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">The case, <em>Glacier Northwest vs. International Brotherhood of Teamsters</em>, debated whether a union can be held responsible for company damages or monetary losses resulting from a union‚Äôs decision to go on strike under the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/guidance/key-reference-materials/national-labor-relations-act" target="_blank">National Labor Relations Act</a>. Cornell‚Äôs Legal Information Institute <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/21-1449" target="_blank">defines the question</a>: ‚ÄúDoes the NLRA preempt an employer‚Äôs state tort claims against a labor union for intentionally destroying the employer‚Äôs property during a strategically-timed labor strike?‚Äù </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">The suit first began in 2017. Glacier Northwest, a concrete-mixing company based in Seattle, Washington, was in the midst of renegotiating a new contract with the Teamsters, one of the oldest and largest unions in the industry. According to the <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/22pdf/21-1449_d9eh.pdf" target="_blank">brief of the case</a>, the contract expired without the two being able to come to a resolution, and as a result, union workers went on strike. However, the work day had already begun, and concrete was already being mixed and delivered when the union ordered a work stoppage. The cement-truck drivers turned around on their delivery routes and drove their trucks back to the concrete plant, and the company had to use ‚Äúemergency maneuvers‚Äù to get the concrete off the trucks before it dried. </span></p>

<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">No significant damage was done to the trucks, but some of that day‚Äôs concrete dried and was therefore unusable‚Äîand so, Glacier Northwest <a href="https://www.justice.gov/sites/default/files/briefs/2022/11/16/21-1449npacunitedstates.pdf" target="_blank">filed a tort action</a> claiming <a href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2023/01/cement-truck-drivers-went-on-strike-a-lawsuit-by-their-company-may-pave-the-way-for-restricting-workers-rights/" target="_blank">‚Äúsabotage‚Äù and ‚Äútortious destruction‚Äù</a> of company property. </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">In response, the Teamsters filed an Unfair Labor Practice charge to the National Labor Relations Board, claiming that the company had sued in retaliation against striking, which is a protected union activity. The Supreme Court then undertook to determine who was in the right‚Äîexcept that, as Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson writes in her dissent, it is customarily the Board that deals with labor disputes first, and all court activity must be suspended until the Board reaches a decision. </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">Eight of the nine Supreme Court justices voted in favor of the company. Justice Amy Coney Barrett authored the opinion. Only Justice Jackson, the newest addition to the court appointed by Joe Biden last year, voted in dissent. She said that because this was a labor dispute, the National Labor Relations Board‚Äîand the complaint that the Board‚Äôs General Counsel <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/case/19-CA-287950" target="_blank">had already filed</a>‚Äîtook precedence, and the Court in fact had no reason to stick its nose in the case. </span></p>

<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">‚ÄúToday, the Court falters,‚Äù Jackson writes. ‚ÄúThe logical implication [in this situation] is that the union‚Äôs conduct is at least <em>arguably</em> protected by the NLRA‚Ä¶we have no business delving into this particular labor dispute at this time.‚Äù </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">‚ÄúThe political hacks at the Supreme Court have again voted in favor of corporations over working people,‚Äù said Teamsters general president Sean O‚ÄôBrien in a <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/06/obrien-scotus-attacks-all-u-s-workers/" target="_blank">statement</a> Thursday morning. ‚ÄúThese corruptible justices should be ashamed of themselves for throwing out long-standing precedent and legislating from the bench. The ability to strike has been on the books for nearly 100 years, and it‚Äôs no coincidence that this ruling is coming at a time when workers across the country are fed up and exercising their rights more and more.‚Äù </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">Union leaders agree that strikes are supposed to be disruptive. But the precedent this case sets is that when a union goes on strike, it has to ensure that it won‚Äôt lose the company any money, said Seth Goldstein, a lawyer at Julien, Mirer, Singla &amp; Goldstein, who has supported organizers in union disputes at Trader Joe‚Äôs and Amazon. </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">‚ÄúThe idea would be that we would have to make sure that everything is perfectly in order before we went out on strike,‚Äù Goldstein said. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs outrageous.‚Äù </span></p>
<div data-component="TweetyBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__tweety"></div>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">‚ÄúUnder [<em>San Diego Building Trades v.</em>] <em>Garmon</em>, and as relevant here, a court presented with a tort suit based on strike conduct generally must pause proceedings and permit the Board to determine in the first instance whether the union‚Äôs conduct is lawful if the conduct at issue is even ‚Äúarguably‚Äù protected by the NLRA,‚Äù Jackson writes, referring to a <a href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/359/236/" target="_blank">previous case</a> in which it was decided that the NLRB takes precedence over state and federal courts when it comes to labor disputes and striking. </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">‚ÄúBut instead of modestly standing down, the majority eagerly inserts itself into this conflict,‚Äù she continues. ‚ÄúIn the course of inappropriately weighing in on the merits of those questions at this stage, the majority also misapplies the Board‚Äôs cases in a manner that threatens to both impede the Board‚Äôs uniform development of labor law and erode the right to strike.‚Äù </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">The NLRA has <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/the-law#:~:text=In%201935%2C%20Congress%20passed%20the,workers'%20full%20freedom%20of%20association." target="_blank">protected union activity</a> since 1935, but this court case marks the latest in a series of Republican-led rollbacks of labor law. The Iowa Senate, for example, recently <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/5d9bwx/iowa-senate-pulls-all-nighter-to-roll-back-child-labor-protections">voted to roll back child labor protections</a>. ‚ÄúThis is a vehicle that the right wing is using to try to stop us from striking,‚Äù Goldstein said. </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">Goldstein doesn‚Äôt believe this ruling will discourage workers from striking. ‚ÄúPeople are not going to put up with sweatshop conditions at Amazon, at Starbucks,‚Äù he said. ‚ÄúThis isn't going to stop millions of workers who are standing up for the right to strike. We see that with Amazon, with the group of OPEIU Local 39 workers that are striking at CUNA for the first time in 80 years, with Trader Joe's, with Starbucks. The new labor movement is going to continue and they're going to continue demanding fair conditions at work. ‚Äù </span></p>
<p><span data-component="TextBlock" data-sanitized-class="abc__textblock size--article">Teamsters president Sean O‚ÄôBrian said that the ruling will not impact the Teamsters‚Äô striking efforts, which is critical given that the union‚Äôs contract with UPS is set to expire in a few months, and <a href="https://teamster.org/2023/05/ups-teamsters-contract-update/" target="_blank">negotiations are making little progress</a>. ‚ÄúToday‚Äôs shameful ruling is simply one more reminder that the American people cannot rely on their government or their courts to protect them,‚Äù O‚ÄôBrian said in the statement. ‚ÄúThey cannot rely on their employers. We must rely on each other. We must engage in organized, collective action. We can only rely on the protections inherent in the power of our unions.‚Äù</span></p></div>

For example, the most common deep learning approach to image classification involves decoding image file bytes into an RGB tensor which is passed into a neural network. Instead, we investigate performing classification directly on file bytes, without the need for decoding files at inference time. Using file bytes as model inputs enables the development of models which can operate on multiple input modalities. Our model, \emph{ByteFormer}, achieves an ImageNet Top-1 classification accuracy of $77.33\%$ when training and testing directly on TIFF file bytes using a transformer backbone with configuration similar to DeiT-Ti ($72.2\%$ accuracy when operating on RGB images). Without modifications or hyperparameter tuning, ByteFormer achieves $95.42\%$ classification accuracy when operating on WAV files from the Speech Commands v2 dataset (compared to state-of-the-art accuracy of $98.7\%$). Additionally, we demonstrate that ByteFormer has applications in privacy-preserving inference. ByteFormer is capable of performing inference on particular obfuscated input representations with no loss of accuracy. We also demonstrate ByteFormer's ability to perform inference with a hypothetical privacy-preserving camera which avoids forming full images by consistently masking $90\%$ of pixel channels, while still achieving $71.35\%$ accuracy on ImageNet. Our code will be made available at <a href="https://github.com/apple/ml-cvnets/tree/main/examples/byteformer" rel="external noopener nofollow" data-sanitized-class="link-external link-https">this https URL</a>.</p>

In particular, generative LLMs have been shown to effectively power AI-based code authoring tools that can suggest entire statements or blocks of code during code authoring. In this paper we present CodeCompose, an AI-assisted code authoring tool developed and deployed at Meta internally. CodeCompose is based on the InCoder LLM that merges generative capabilities with bi-directionality. We have scaled up CodeCompose to serve tens of thousands of developers at Meta, across 10+ programming languages and several coding surfaces.<br>We discuss unique challenges in terms of user experience and metrics that arise when deploying such tools in large-scale industrial settings. We present our experience in making design decisions about the model and system architecture for CodeCompose that addresses these challenges. Finally, we present metrics from our large-scale deployment of CodeCompose that shows its impact on Meta's internal code authoring experience over a 15-day time window, where 4.5 million suggestions were made by CodeCompose. Quantitative metrics reveal that (i) CodeCompose has an acceptance rate of 22% across several languages, and (ii) 8% of the code typed by users of CodeCompose is through accepting code suggestions from CodeCompose. Qualitative feedback indicates an overwhelming 91.5% positive reception for CodeCompose. In addition to assisting with code authoring, CodeCompose is also introducing other positive side effects such as encouraging developers to generate more in-code documentation, helping them with the discovery of new APIs, etc.</p>

<h2>Hash Functions</h2>
</a><p>Hash functions are functions that map a bit vector to another bit vector, usually shorter than the original vector and usually of fixed length for a particular function.</p>
<p>There are three primary uses for hash functions:<br></p>
<ol><li>Fast table lookup<br></li>
<li>Message digests<br></li>
<li>Encryption<br></li>
</ol><p><strong>Fast Table Lookup</strong></p>
<p>Fast table lookup can be implemented using a hash function and a hash table. Elements are found in the hash table by calculating the hash of the element‚Äôs key and using the hash value as the index into the table. This is clearly faster than other methods, such as examining each element of the table sequentially to find a match.</p>
<p><strong>Message Digests</strong></p>
<p>Message digests allow you to compare two large bit vectors and quickly determine if they are equal. Instead of comparing the vectors bit-by-bit, if the hash values of each bit vector are available you can compare the hash values. If the hash values are different, the original vectors must be different. If the hash values are the same then the original vectors are very likely to be the same if the hash function is good.</p>
<p>Message digests can use either cryptographic or non-cryptographic hash functions. If the purpose of the message digest is to determine if the original message has been tampered with, you would need to use a cryptographic hash function. If you just want to quickly tell if it‚Äôs the same as another file with a different name (assuming the hash values have already been computed), you can use a non-cryptographic hash function.</p>
<p><strong>Encryption</strong></p>
<p>Encryption is the transformation of data into a form unreadable by anyone without a secret decryption key. Hash functions play an important role in encryption because it is their properties that cause the encrypted data to be unreadable and the original data to be unrecoverable from the encrypted data without the decryption key.</p>
<p>Hash functions in this context are sometimes given other names such as mixing functions.</p>

<h2>Properties of Hash Functions</h2>
<p>For a function to be useful as a hash function, it must exhibit the property of <em>uniform distribution</em>. Some hash functions also have the <em>one-way</em> property. If a hash function is to be used for cryptography or for fast table lookup where the nature of the keys is unknown, the one-way property is a requirement.</p>
<p><strong>Uniform Distribution</strong></p>
<p>All good hash functions share the property of <em>collision avoidance</em>, which means that the desired behavior is for unique inputs to provide unique outputs. If the length of the input vector is greater than the length of the output vector it‚Äôs impossible to avoid all collisions because the set of input vectors will be of greater order than the set of output vectors. The hash function partitions the input set into subsets of input vectors that all produce the same output.</p>
<p>Since collisions cannot be avoided, the goal is to minimize their likelihood given two arbitrary input vectors. Minimization occurs when the size of the largest partition is minimized, that is, when the output vectors are evenly distributed among the corresponding input vectors. When this happens we say the output vectors are <em>uniformly distributed</em>.</p>
<p><strong>One-Way Functions</strong></p>
<p>Another important goal is that ‚Äúsimilar‚Äù input vectors produce very different output vectors. For the case of table lookup, table keys are usually either human language strings, index numbers, or other data that exhibit non-randomness. For the case of message digest functions, the goal is to make it as difficult as possible to find two different messages that result in the same hash. A hash function with this property is called a <em>one-way</em> hash function.</p>
<p>Not all applications require hash functions to be one-way, but all cryptographic applications do. For example, a hash value for fast table lookup where the keys are telephone numbers could simply be the last four digits of the phone number. This hash function is suitable because it‚Äôs likely to be uniformly distributed, but it‚Äôs clearly not one-way because it is easy to devise a phone number that has a specific hash value.</p>

<p><em>Collision! Two different input vectors produce the same output vector. For hash tables, this means that the second table insertion will be slower because an alternate location will need to be used. For non-cryptographic message digests, it means that two messages will appear to be the same when they are not. For cryptographic message digests, it means the contents of the message and/or the identity of the sender can be undetectibly altered. </em></p>

<h2>Simple Hash Function</h2>
<p>Figure 1.</p>
<pre>uint Hash(string s)
{
    uint hash = 0;
    foreach (char c in s)
    {
        hash = hash * 33 + (uint) c;
    }
    return hash;
}                               </pre>
<p>Let‚Äôs look at a simple hash function. Figure 1 shows a hash function intended to be used for a hash table where the keys are character strings.</p>
<p>The hash value is initialized to zero at the start of the function, then for each character in the string the hash value is multiplied by 33 and the Unicode code point value is added to the hash value. No overflow checking is specified, so in C# the value will just wrap around within the range of System.UInt32 if it gets big enough.</p>
<p>The multiplication by 33 is called the <em>mixing step</em> and the function <em>f</em> : <code>uint</code> ‚Üí <code>uint</code> defined by <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>) = <em>x</em> * 33 where * is the C# multiply-without-overflow operator is called the <em>mixing function</em>. The constant 33 is chosen arbitrarily.</p>
<p>The addition of the Unicode code point value of the character is called the <em>combining step</em> and the function <em>g</em> :<code>uint</code> √ó <code>uint</code> ‚Üí <code>uint</code> defined by <em>g</em>(<em>x</em>, <em>y</em>) = <em>x</em> + <em>y</em> where + is the C# add-without-overflow operator is called the <em>combining function</em>.</p>
<p>Note that this particular hash function has dubious uniform distribution properties. We‚Äôll evaluate that more later.</p>
<h2>Hash Function Structure</h2>

    {
        // combining step

        // mixing step
        hash = Mix(hash);
    }

    hash -= hash &lt;&lt; 13;
    return hash;
}</pre>
<p>The preceding hash function was too simple to illustrate all of the structures commonly found in hash functions. Figure 2 shows a more complete example.</p>
<ol><li>First is the initialization step, where the internal state of the hash function is readied.</li>
<li>Next, the message is split up into zero or more blocks of equal size, and the internal state of the hash function is updated for each block. In this example, the message is divided into 32-bit blocks. For each block, the combining function is applied to the prior state and the bits from the current block, and then the mixing function is called. This step is repeated for each full-sized block in the message.</li>
<li>Then the final, partial block is processed, if necessary. The combining step is modified to accommodate the incomplete block.</li>
<li>Finally, some final processing is done to further randomize the internal state. In this case, the mixing step is applied two more times.</li>
</ol><p>If you examine the hash function from figure 1 again, you‚Äôll see that it almost follows this structure. The initialization step is there (the hash value is set to zero), and the message is processed in blocks of 16-bits. There is no post-processing step, or rather there is an ‚Äúempty‚Äù post-processing step.</p>
<p>The main difference is that in figure 1 the mixing step is performed before the combining step for each block. And since there is no post-processing step, it‚Äôs clear that the bits from the last message block are not processed by the mixing function and therefore do not affect the upper 16 bits of the hash value. If you were to use this hash function for hash table lookup you would want to be sure to use the lower-order bits of the hash value instead of the upper-order bits.</p>
<p>Later we‚Äôll examine the mysterious constants in this program, in the initialization step and in the mixing function, to determine whether this is a ‚Äúgood‚Äù hash function.</p>
<p><strong>Padding the Last Block</strong></p>
<p>For non-cryptographic use, it‚Äôs not extremely important how the partial final block is handled. Usually it‚Äôs OK just to pad the message with 0‚Äôs. But this is unacceptable for cryptographic use. If all you do is pad with 0‚Äôs then it is easy to find two messages with the same hash value‚Äì just take a known message with a partial final block and append a zero to it. When the additional 0‚Äôs are added for padding, the two messages look identical. If you just pad with 1‚Äôs instead, then you can add a 1 bit to an existing message.</p>
<p>For this and other reasons, cryptographic hash functions always pad the original message with a number of bits even if the original message was an even block size, and they always incorporate the message length into the hash calculation. The SHA-1 hash function, for example, always pads the message with a 1 bit, and the last 64 bits of the last block contain the message length, in bits. The bits between the final 1 and the length bits are set to 0. This scheme prevents an attacker from devising two different messages that are identical after the padding operation.</p>
<h2>Mixing Functions</h2>
<p>The heart of a hash function is its mixing step. The behavior of the mixing function largely determines whether the hash function is collision-resistant. Therefore it shouldn‚Äôt be surprising that good mixing functions have the same attributes as good hash functions, namely collision resistance and uniform distribution.</p>
<p>The most notable difference between a mixing function and a hash function is that the input and output of a mixing function are the same size. The purpose of the mixing function is to ‚Äúscramble‚Äù or mix the internal state of the hash function. The input to the function is the current internal state and the output of the function becomes the new internal state.</p>
<p>Because the input and output are the same size, mixing functions <em>can</em> attain complete collision-resistance, and they should. If the mixing function exhibits collisions, the hash function will exhibit more collisions than are necessary. Collisions are guaranteed not to happen if the mixing function is <em>reversible</em>, that is, it‚Äôs possible to determine the input of the mixing function by examining the output. If the function is not reversible, it implies that there are at least two inputs that result in the same output. By definition, that is a collision.</p>
<p><strong>Reversible Operations</strong></p>
<p>Figure 3</p>
<p><em>Reversible operations</em></p>
<pre>hash ^= constant;
hash *= constant; // if constant is odd
hash += constant;
hash -= constant;
hash ^= hash &gt;&gt; constant;
hash ^= hash &lt;&lt; constant;
hash += hash &lt;&lt; constant;
hash -= hash &lt;&lt; constant;
hash = (hash &lt;&lt; 27) | (hash &gt;&gt; 5); // if 32 bits</pre>
<p><em>Non-reversible operations</em></p>
<pre>hash |= constant;
hash &amp;= constant;
hash &lt;&lt;= constant;
hash &gt;&gt;= constant;
hash *= constant; // if constant is even
hash /= constant;
hash %= constant;
hash += hash &gt;&gt; constant;</pre>
<p>Figure 3 lists some reversible and non-reversible mixing operations. It is assumed that the ‚Äúhash‚Äù variable is an unsigned integer and that the arithmetic operations are performed modulo 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> where <em>n</em> is the size of the hash variable in bits. It is also assumed that 0 &lt; constant &lt; 2<sup><em>n</em></sup>. A mixing function is guaranteed to be reversible if it consists of steps that are each reversible.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this article it‚Äôs not important <em>how</em> to reverse these operations, but you may be curious and it‚Äôs definitely not obvious for some of them. The ^= operation is easy‚Äîjust repeat it. The += and -= operations can be reversed with -= and +=.</p>
<p>The ^= operation combined with &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; shift is an interesting one. To reverse <code>hash ^= hash &gt;&gt; 9</code> for example, you would do <code>hash ^= (hash &gt;&gt; 9) ^ (hash &gt;&gt; 18) ^ (hash &gt;&gt; 27)</code>.</p>
<p>The += and -= operations combined with &lt;&lt; or &gt;&gt; shifts are equivalent to *= and can be restated that way.</p>
<p>The *= operation is the most difficult to reverse. Look up <em>modular inverse</em> and <em>Euclidean algorithm</em> in your favorite search engine for details. Because of this difficulty, it‚Äôs tempting to use this type of mixing step for one-way hash functions. Whether or not this is a good choice largely depends on the performance of the CPU. Some CPU‚Äôs perform multiplication quickly and some take much longer than addition and subtraction. If multiplication is slow and the constant has a small number of bits set to 1, then equivalent operations using += and left-shifts will work.</p>
<h2>Avalanche!</h2>
<p>The purpose of the mixing function is to spread the effect of each message bit throughout all the bits of the internal state. Ideally every bit in the hash state is affected by every bit in the message. And we want to do that as quickly as possible simply for the sake of program performance.</p>
<p>A function is said to satisfy the <em>strict avalanche criterion </em>if, whenever a single input bit is complemented (toggled between 0 and 1), each of the output bits should change with a probability of one half for an arbitrary selection of the remaining input bits.</p>
<p>The avalanche criterion can be tested for the hash function as a whole, or for just the mixing function. As a part of the overall evaluation of the hash function it makes sense to examine the avalanche behavior of the mixing function first.</p>
<p>The avalanche behavior can be exactly determined if the size of the hash state is small. If it is larger, such as 160 bits for the SHA-1 hash, it usually has to be estimated. It is possible to construct a mixing function with large bit size for which the avalanche behavior can be exactly calculated, but these mixing functions are usually slow.</p>

<p>Let‚Äôs look at a 4-bit mixing function to illustrate the general method for calculating the probabilities that each input but will affect each output bit. Figure 4 shows a mixing operation and lists all possible input values and their corresponding output values. By examining this table we can determine the probability that bit 1, for example, will affect bit 3.</p>
<p>To determine the effect of bit 1, we look at all eight possible combinations of the other three input bits and group the sixteen input values into eight pairs where each element of each pair differs only in bit 1. Input values 4 and 6 form such a pair if we are considering bit 1. These two input values match in bit positions 0, 2, and 3. The other pairs for bit 1 are 0 and 2, 1 and 3, 5 and 7, 8 and 10, etc.</p>
<p>Next we examine the corresponding pairs of output values to see which bits change when bit 1 changes. For input values 4 and 6 we see that the corresponding output values change in bits 1, 2, and 3 but output bit 0 does not change when bit 1 of the input changes. Therefore we say that bit 1 of the input affects bits 1, 2, and 3 of the output but not bit 0. If we look at all eight input pairs for bit 1, we find that bit 0 changes for none of the pairs, bit 1 changes for all of the pairs, bit 2 changes for 50% of the pairs, and bit 3 changes for 75% of the pairs. Therefore this mixing step <em>by itself</em> does not come close to satisfying the strict avalanche criterion. We want to see about 50% for each output bit position for each input bit.</p>
<p><strong>Propagation Criterion</strong></p>
<p>The strict avalanche condition is a special case of the <em>propagation criterion</em>. It‚Äôs called the propagation criterion of degree 1, which means that if you toggle any single bit of the input, each output bit will change 50% of the time if you consider all the possible combinations of the <em>n</em> - 1 remaining bits.</p>
<p>A function satisfies the propagation criterion of degree 2 if you toggle any <em>two</em> bits in the input, each output bit changes 50% of the time if you consider all the possible combinations of the <em>n</em> - 2 remaining bits.</p>
<p>This method of calculating the avalanche behavior is only feasible because there are only four bits to deal with. For a 32-bit mixing function, we would have to examine sixty-four-thousand million pairs. This can be done with a PC given sufficient time, but it would be out of the question for a 64-bit, 96-bit, or larger mixing function.</p>
<p>For larger mixing functions we can estimate the avalanche behavior by choosing input values at random and toggling each bit on and off to see which output bits are affected. If we keep a total of the results for each random choice, then if we choose a lot of random input values we can get a good estimate of the probabilities.</p>

        state += (state &lt;&lt; 7);
        state ^= (state &gt;&gt; 12);
    }
}</pre>
<p>Before we write a program to calculate bit-to-bit avalanche behavior, we‚Äôll need a ‚Äúharness‚Äù into which we can strap different mixing functions. Figure 5 shows an abstract base class for a mixing function that ensures that each mixing function will have the same interface. I used an abstract class instead of an <code>interface</code> because we need to have a member variable for the hash state. This version has a 32-bit member variable called <code>state</code>.</p>
<p>Figure 5 also shows a 32-bit mixing function designed by <a href="https://href.li/?http://burtleburtle.net/bob/">Bob Jenkins</a>. It is intended to be used for a hash table with integer keys. It‚Äôs tempting to think you can tell which bits affect which other bits just by looking at the code. For example, after the first step <code>state += (state &lt;&lt; 12)</code>, it‚Äôs pretty clear that bits 0 through 19 will affect bits 12 through 31 in some way. But when you combine this step with subsequent steps it‚Äôs possible that some of these effects will cancel out earlier effects. The last step shifts things 12 bits to the right, for example. And if you look at all the steps <em>except</em> the last and add up all the shifts, counting left shifts as positive and right shifts as negative, you‚Äôll see that the total amount of shifting before the last step is zero. It‚Äôs complicated. We‚Äôll just have to measure it to see how it does.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll create a function for calculating the <em>avalanche matrix</em>. Each element <code>i,j</code> of this 32x32 matrix of floating-point values will tell us the probability that bit <code>i</code> of the input will affect bit <code>j</code> of the output. We want to see a value of 0.5 for every combination.</p>
<p>The best place to put this function is in the <code>MixingFunction </code>base class, which means the function automatically becomes available as a member function for any mixing function we create. It essentially becomes a feature of mixing functions in general, instead of having to create this method in some other class and then passing the mixing function as a parameter to the function.</p>

<p>Figure 6 shows the code for the <code>AvalancheMatrix</code> method of the <code>MixingFunction</code> class. It takes two parameters. The first is <code>trials</code> which is the number of random input vectors we‚Äôre going to generate. Evaluating all 2<sup>31</sup>different combinations of input vectors for each bit combination will take too long, so we‚Äôll just pick about a million of them at random. That‚Äôs the <code>trials</code> parameter.</p>
<p>The second parameter is <code>repetitions</code>. We‚Äôll see in a little while that even if a mixing function doesn‚Äôt achieve avalanche in one call, it will sometimes do better if the mixing is performed two or more times in a row. The<code>repetitions</code> parameter lets us easily test the behavior of multiple applications of the mixing function.</p>
<p>The first thing the function does is to ensure the mixing function is a 32-bit mixing function, since this version of the algorithm doesn‚Äôt support other sizes. We also check that the function parameters are valid.</p>
<p>Next we declare our variables, initialize some of them (C# initializes everything else to default values automatically), allocate some memory, and initialize the random number generator. I used RNGCryptoServiceProvider from the System.Security.Cryptography namespace because I know the System.Random class has linear correlations between values <em>x<sub>n</sub></em>, <em>x<sub>n-34</sub></em>, and <em>x<sub>n-55</sub></em> since it is a two-tap linear feedback PRNG. I‚Äôm not 100% sure what RNGCryptoServiceProvider is doing, but the scanty documentation I‚Äôve seen suggest it uses entropy sources for seed generation and updating, and a cryptographic hash for output whitening. I like that better, although it‚Äôs really slow.</p>
<p>Inside the main loop we start by getting 32 random bits and setting the internal state. We also save that state for later. Then we call the mixing function the appropriate number of times and save the new state.</p>
<p>Then we toggle each of the 32 input bits one at a time with the statement <code>state = save ^ (1U &lt;&lt; i)</code>, then we mix that new state and compare it to the original mixed state by doing <code>outb = state ^ inb</code> which gives us 0‚Äôs where the two states match and 1‚Äôs where they differ. Then we count the 1‚Äôs and keep a tally.</p>
<p>Finally, after all the trials are finished, we divide each count by the total number of trials to normalize them into the [0, 1] range. Remember that 0.5 is our goal.</p>

<p>Each row represents an input bit and each column represents an output bit. So to determine the probability that bit 6 affects bit 1, look at the row numbered ‚Äú6‚Äù (the 7th row) and the column numbered ‚Äú1‚Äù and you‚Äôll see that the result is 51%.</p>
<p>The technical term for these results is <em>sweet</em>. We can be pretty confident that this mixing function will do a good job at collision-avoidance with 32-bit integers for the purposes of hash table lookup.</p>
<p>But if we examine the data <em>very</em> closely, we do find that this function doesn‚Äôt behave quite the same as a function that satisfies the strict avalanche criterion (SAC) would. This does <em>not</em> suggest that this is a bad mixing function. It‚Äôs very good. I‚Äôm just using it as an example to show how to analyze the avalanche behavior.</p>
<p>The numbers in red show the places where the probability differs by at least 4% from the expected value. For example, the 0th bit affects the 31st bit 54% of the time. To tell whether this is significant or whether it‚Äôs just a random variation due to the fact that we didn‚Äôt actually check <em>every</em> combination of input bits and instead just did a sample, we need to compare this to a mixing function that satisfies SAC exactly.</p>
<p>Such a function would have exactly a 50% probability in every position, but because we‚Äôre sampling there would be variations. Since we did one million samples it would behave like flipping a coin one million times, and we would see a binomial distribution. This would look essentially the same as a normal distribution with a mean of 50 and a standard deviation of 0.05. But some positions would be worse than others. With 1024 elements (32 √ó 32), we can expect that the <em>worst</em> positive deviation is going to be about 3.5 standard deviations above the mean, or about 0.175. Because this is well under 0.5, we shouldn‚Äôt see any non-50‚Äôs in the table if we round to the nearest 1%.</p>

</pre>
<p>Since we don‚Äôt (yet) know of a mixing function that obeys SAC exactly, we can instead create one that actually does a 50% coin flip (simulated). This isn‚Äôt a real mixing function because the outputs don‚Äôt depend on the inputs, but it will fool the avalanche calculator into thinking it‚Äôs real. Figure 8 shows this mixing function.</p>
<p>I won‚Äôt show the results of this function here because it would be a complete waste of bandwidth, but you can run it yourself and see that it shows 50‚Äôs in every position, and the raw data shows that the worst positions probably deviate from this by about 0.175 percentage points (it varies each time you run it, of course, so your results may differ).</p>

<p>If you compare the Jenkins32 function to a more primitive multiplicative mixer that people have used in real hash functions, you‚Äôll see that we could do much, much worse. Figure 9 shows such a function and a sub-section of the results matrix. It clearly shows that this hash function is bad at propagating high-order bits into low-order bit positions. Whether that‚Äôs acceptible or not depends on the application. And it‚Äôs not really as bad as it seems, because the intended use of this function requires taking a prime modulus of the final value, which does scramble the lower bits somewhat.</p>
<p><strong>Can We Do Better?</strong></p>
<p>Is it possible to do better than Jenkins32? The answer is yes. To illustrate this, let‚Äôs just run Jenkins32 <em>twice</em>. The first step already does a great job at mixing, so if we do it twice it should be even better, right? We can easily do this by calling the <code>AvalancheMatrix</code> method with a <code>repetitions </code>parameter of 2. And we find that, in fact, the results are near-perfect. They are practically indistinguishable from a SAC-perfect mixing function.</p>
<p>Note that this <em>isn‚Äôt</em> true of every mixing function. With <code>KnuthMultiplicative</code>, those 0‚Äôs and 100‚Äôs never go away because of where they‚Äôre positioned.</p>
<p>You might wonder if a mixing function that exactly satisfies SAC even exists. Once again the answer is yes. Figure 10 shows a 4-bit mixing function with this property. The truth table of this function is shown so you can confirm that SAC is actually satisfied.</p>

<p>We know that we can get arbitrarily close just by concatenating a good-enough function two or more times. The challenge is to get closer without adding additional computation time.</p>
<p><strong>Mixing Function Search</strong></p>
<p>Warning! I can think of no practical reason why you would need ‚Äúperfect‚Äù avalanche instead of the excellent avalanche achieved by the <code>Jenkins32</code> integer hash. The rest of this page is motivated purely by intellectual curiosity.</p>
<p>To create the mixing function of Figure 10 I did a random search of different permutation tables until I came across one that satisfied the SAC. That works for a 4-bit function, but a lookup table isn‚Äôt going to be feasible for a 32-bit or larger function. So we can choose to limit our search to functions that are a combination of the reversible operations from the previous page. That‚Äôs where those ‚Äúmagic numbers‚Äù come in. We choose them at random! Some values will be good, some will be bad, but we have a way to measure to see which are the best.</p>
<p>But a completely random search will be too slow. Even if we restrict our search to functions of the same form as<code>Jenkins32</code>, that‚Äôs still 31<sup>8</sup> combinations, or almost a million million. And most of those will be complete rubbish.</p>

<p>Instead what we‚Äôll do is start with a known-good function and try modifying each of the constants one at a time to see if we can improve on the previous avalanche matrix. In order to compare two functions to determine which is better, we‚Äôll need a single number that summarizes the avalance matrix results. I chose to use the ‚Äúsum of squared errors‚Äù, which just means I take the difference between each matrix entry and the expected value of 0.5, square it, and then sum all 1024 values together.</p>
<p>I used 100 thousand trials for the matrix calculation. If you use too few trials there is too much ‚Äúnoise‚Äù in the results and you can‚Äôt reliably compare values. The minimum result we can expect to get this way is 0.00256, which is what you would get if the each matrix value were distributed binomially, which is what you‚Äôd expect from a function that satisfies SAC. <code>Jenkins32</code> gets about 0.0257, about 10 times the expected squared error.</p>
<p>Figure 11 shows the trajectory of the best ‚Äúsearch path‚Äù that I‚Äôve been able to find using <code>Jenkins32</code> as the starting point. It shows that we‚Äôre able to reduce the squared error essentially equal to the theoretical minimum, minus some sampling noise.</p>

It requires that all the data is contained in a single octet array, whereas in reality you may need to provide data in chunks or in a format other than octets. But this definition is sufficient for our evaluation scenario where we control the keys.</p>
<p>The base class includes functionality for generating random keys for various tests. This function is independent of the behavior of any particular hash function.</p>
<p>In the preceding section we looked at the avalanche behavior of mixing functions. Now we‚Äôre ready to look at the behavior of full hash functions including initialization, combining, mixing, and post-processing steps. We‚Äôll evaluate the avalanche, distribution, and correlation performance of several existing string hash functions, including a hash with 96-bit internal state by Bob Jenkins, the Fowler/Noll/Vo (FNV) 32-bit hash, a simplistic hash for a baseline comparison, and a cryptographic hash.</p>
<p>First we‚Äôll describe the tests and provide results for our baseline hash function (defined below), and in subsequent sections we‚Äôll evaluate each hash function individually. Finally, we‚Äôll summarize the results for all of our test candidates.</p>
<h2>What to Look For in a Hash Function</h2>
<p>Before we do some testing, I want to point out that the true test involves testing the hash function <em>in situ</em>. Different applications have different hash requirements, and what works well in one situation may not work well in another. What we‚Äôre going to look at is the generic behavior of hash functions, assuming we know nothing about the keys that are going to be hashed. This should tell us something about the worst-case performance of the functions.</p>
<p>Since we assume no knowledge about the hash keys, we‚Äôll use completely random keys. Keys will be arrays of octets. We‚Äôll use keys that consist of uniformly distributed octets, keys that simulate text, and keys that are very bit-sparse (a single ‚Äú1‚Äù bit per octet). Why not just use random keys with uniformly distributed octets? Because a hash function isn‚Äôt truly needed in that scenario. If you know ahead of time that your keys are composed of completely random bits, you can just use a subsection of the key as your hash value and be guaranteed perfect distribution properties. Adding ‚Äútext‚Äù keys and sparse keys will illustrate a broader range of real-world requirements.</p>
<p>Good <em>general purpose</em> hash functions should have these properties:</p>
<ol><li>The output should be uniformly distributed. Each pattern of output bits should be equally likely. We‚Äôll use a one-tailed œá<sup>2</sup> bucket test for this. See <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.mste.uiuc.edu/patel/chisquare/intro.html">this site</a> by Amar Patel for a very clear explanation of the œá<sup>2 </sup>test, or <a href="https://href.li/?http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-square_test">this page</a> for a more formal explanation.</li>
<li>Every input bit should affect every output bit about 50% of the time if you consider all possible combinations of the other input bits. This is the avalanche condition. Conversely, every output bit should be affected by every input bit. This is similar to the ‚Äúno-funnels‚Äù condition described by Bob Jenkins. We‚Äôll need to modify our avalanche evaluator to handle variable-sized input bit vectors.</li>
<li>There should be no correlations between pairs of output bits. If output bits are correlated, you‚Äôre not getting a full <em>n</em> bits of output. We won‚Äôt test for this because it is easy for all but the most unsuitable hash functions to avoid these correlations.</li>
<li>It should be computationally infeasible to identify two keys that produce the same hash value or to identify a key that produces a given hash value. This is a requirement for cryptographic hashes, which are much longer than 32-bits. Since it‚Äôs easy to find collisions for even an ideal 32-bit hash, this isn‚Äôt a requirement that we‚Äôll use.</li>

<pre>public class SimpleHash : HashFunction
{
    public override 
        uint ComputeHash(byte[] data)
    {
        uint hash = 0;
        foreach (byte b in data)
            hash = (hash + b) * 0x50003;
        return hash;
    }
}</pre>
<h2>Test Harness</h2>
<p>We first need to create a test harness for hash functions just like we did for mixing functions. Figure 12 shows the <code>HashFunction</code> abstract base class which we‚Äôll use for all the hashes we‚Äôll investigate. We‚Äôre going to assume a 32-bit hash output for all the hash functions.</p>
<p>Different types of keys require different lengths. In order for the œá<sup>2</sup> tests with 2<sup>16</sup> buckets to be valid, all of the keys need to contain at least 16 bits of information. The sparse keys only contain three bits of information in each octet, so we need at least six octets to ensure 16 bits of information. The ‚Äútext‚Äù keys contain 4.34 bits per octet on average, so we need at least four octets for that one. We only need two octets for the uniformly distributed octets.</p>
<p>Figure 13 lists a rudimentary hash function which we‚Äôll use to work out our testing methodology. The constant <code>0x50003</code> was selected for the ability for the ‚Äú3‚Äù to mix key bits into the lower half of the hash value and the ‚Äú5‚Äù to mix key bits into the upper half. We avoid using the same number for both halves to minimize correlations between each set of bits.</p>

This hash has severe weaknesses for hash tables with 2</em><sup>14</sup><em>or more buckets, although this function did acceptably well in the upper bits for sparse keys all the way up to 2</em><sup>16</sup><em>buckets. Therefore this is a fast, simple, and easy-to-remember function suitable for small hash tables up to 8192 buckets for a wide variety of keys.</em></p>
<h2>Testing Uniform Distribution</h2>
<p>Hash functions used with hash tables of size 2<sup><em>n</em></sup> would typically use only the lower-order bits of a 32-bit hash function output. But to be thorough in our tests we‚Äôll look at the distribution properties of both the low-order and high-order bits, up to 16 bits long.</p>
<p>For each test we‚Äôll call the hash function repeatedly with random keys, and look to see which bucket we‚Äôre assigned. We‚Äôll count the hits to each bucket, and compare the result to the expected result for a truly uniform distribution. We‚Äôll use the one-tailed œá<sup>2</sup> test for this. (We don‚Äôt care if the distribution is ‚Äútoo uniform‚Äù since we‚Äôre throwing random keys at each function. If we were testing a random number generator we might want a two-tailed test.) The œá<sup>2</sup>degrees of freedom for each measurement will be 2<sup><em>m</em></sup>-1, where <em>m</em> is the bit-size of the sub-range that we‚Äôre testing.</p>
<p>The result of each œá<sup>2</sup> test will be a p-value, which is a number from 0.0 to 1.0, and we would expect these to be uniformly distributed in that range if the hash output is uniform. The p-value indicates the probability that a truly uniform distribution would be worse that the observed distribution by chance alone. For example a p-value of 0.01 indicates that a truly uniform distribution would only be worse than the observed distribution only 1% of the time, which is bad.</p>
<p>Even if we define p=0.01 as the cut-off for a ‚Äúbad‚Äù distribution, a truly uniform distribution would have a p-value worse than this 1% of the time, by definition. So we need to look at each failure in context to see if it‚Äôs likely just random chance or whether it forms part of a pattern. In general I will re-run a test several times to determine which results are significant and which are not, and I only present the most representative results. I wouldn‚Äôt do this in a scientific context, but this isn‚Äôt that.</p>

Some output bits are not mixed at all. The fact that the LSB doesn‚Äôt get mixed at all indicates that this hash would not provide a uniform distribution if the LSBs of the keys were not already uniform.</em></p>
<p>This overall behavior is typical of multiplicative hashes unless extra steps are taken during post-processing to improve the mixing behavior.</p>
<p>For each test, we‚Äôll generate enough random keys to fill each bucket with an average of 100 keys. The key length will be a random variable <code><em>k</em>+floor(sqrt(-800*ln(<em>x</em>)))</code>where <em>x</em> is a uniformly distributed random variable on (0, 1] and <em>k</em> is the minimum key length required to produce 16 bits of data in the key, which varies by the type of key. The function <code>floor</code> indicates rounding down, <code>sqrt</code>indicates square-root, and <code>ln</code> is the natural logarithm. We‚Äôll need a minimum key length of at least <em>k</em> because we‚Äôll be doing œá<sup>2</sup> tests with up to 2<sup>16</sup> buckets, and the presence of some too-short keys would force non-uniform output in those cases and cause those tests to fail regardless of the hash function used.</p>
<p>Figure 14 shows the results for the <code>SimpleHash</code> function. It shows weakness in both the upper and lower bits when use 14 or more of the bits. The upper bits are a little stronger‚Äìthis half of the hash gets some ‚Äúoverflow‚Äù from multiplications that carry out of the lower half.</p>
<h2>Avalanche Testing</h2>
<p>If a hash function passes the uniform distribution test, why do any of the other tests matter? While it‚Äôs true that the primary use for most hashes is for hash table lookup, that‚Äôs not the only use. Small hashes can be used for non-cryptographic document fingerprinting, for example. Also, other tests can identify classes of keys for which the uniform distribution might fail even if the tests with random keys succeed.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous section which pursued the Strict Avalanche Condition to paranoid levels, we‚Äôll consider ‚Äúgood enough‚Äù avalanche to be when each input bit affects each output bit between 1/3rd and 2/3rds of the time. The mixing function will be applied repeatedly in most cases, which will only improve the avalanche behavior if it‚Äôs good enough to start with. If single-round avalanche is borderline, we might consider calling the mixing function one or two more times as part of the post-processing step. This test will tell is which functions would benefit from that.</p>
<p>The definition of avalanche requires that we only evaluate keys with uniformly distributed input octets, so this test won‚Äôt use GetTextKeys or GetSparseKeys. Also, it‚Äôs challenging to test every input bit when keys get very long, so we‚Äôre going to restrict keys to specific lengths. We‚Äôll examine two-octet keys which will allow us to exactly calculate the avalanche matrix, as well as four-octet keys for which we‚Äôll need to do sampling just as before. Finally we‚Äôll use 256-octet keys to see the avalanche behavior when multiple rounds of the mixing function are used, and we‚Äôll look at input bits in the first and last octets.</p>
<p>The 16x32 and 32x32 avalanche matrices are cumbersome to present on a web page, so we‚Äôll use a graphical summary of the results instead. We‚Äôll use green squares for bit combinations that achieved avalanche, orange squares that did not, and red squares where the input bits had either no affect or a direct affect on the output (0% or 100% affect).</p>
<p>Figure 15 shows the results of the avalanche tests for the <code>SimpleHash</code> function. Next we‚Äôll look at some other well-known hash functions.</p>

<p>This hash function is described <a href="https://href.li/?http://www.isthe.com/chongo/tech/comp/fnv/">here</a>. It is a simple multiplicative hash with the addition of a post-processing step called <em>xor-folding</em> to remove some linearity in the lower bits. The FNV authors recommend using xor-folding if the desired hash size is not a power of 2, but they actually mean to use xor-folding when the hash size is not a power of 2 or is less than 32.</p>
<p>There are different initialization and multiplication constants for use with 32-bit, 64-bit, 128-bit hashes, etc., but we‚Äôll only examine the 32-bit version of FNV here. In our uniform distribution test we‚Äôll use xor-folding for the lower bits since that is the intended use of this hash, but we‚Äôll examine the upper bits as-is. Since our avalanche test is a full 32-bit test, we can‚Äôt use xor-folding there. This will allow us to identify classes of keys for which using xor-folding is a necessity.</p>
<p>The primary appeals of this hash are its simplicity and its speed, but its speed is dependent on whether or not the CPU architecture supports fast integer multiplication. The Jenkins shift-add-xor hashes are faster on CPU architectures without fast multiplication.</p>
<p>Figure fnv1 shows the listing for the FNV 32-bit hash.</p>
<p><strong>Uniform Distribution Test</strong></p>
<p>We examine the distribution of numbers derived from lower and upper bits of the hash output in sizes of 1 through 16 bits.</p>
<p>Figure fnv3 shows the results of this test for the FNV hash. This test indicates that the FNV 32-bit hash with xor-folding produces uniformly distributed values for hash tables that are a power of two, up to at least 2<sup>14</sup>, when the key octets are uniformly distributed, distributed similar to alphabetic text, or sparsely distributed.</p>

<p>The upper bits are not uniformly distributed if you use more than 14 or 15 bits. Because of this, I don‚Äôt recommend using this hash with hash tables larger than 2<sup>14</sup> buckets. The results are acceptible up to 2<sup>16</sup> bits for text keys, so you may be able to use it for that purpose if you carefully test the performance in your particular application.</p>
<p><strong>Avalanche Test</strong></p>
<p>We examine the diffusion of input bits into different bit positions in the output.</p>
<p>Figure fnv2 shows the results of this test for the FNV hash. This test indicates that the FNV hash has poor avalanche behavior, as do all simple multiplicative hashes. This means that there will be some classes of keys for which the hash function does not produce uniform output, even for small bucket counts where the œá<sup>2</sup> tests succeeded above.</p>
<p>Of particular concern are the two low-order bits. These are always just a simple linear function of the two low-order bits of the keys octets. For example, in the full 32-bit hash value, the low-order bit will always just be a simple XOR of the LSBs of the key octets and the LSB from the intialization constant. Also of concern is that fact that the upper bits of the key octets do not have any influence on the low-order bits of the hash output (without xor-folding). The MSB of each key octet does not diffuse at all into the entire lower 8 bits of the hash value. This indicates that you <em>must</em> follow the xor-folding recommendations for all classes of keys.</p>
<p>Also, the mixing step of this hash is never applied to the last octet of the key. This shows clearly in the avalanche results. The authors offer an alternative form of the hash where the combining step is done <em>before</em> the mixing step, and I recommend that you adopt this alternative if you use FNV. There is no reason to do otherwise, and I‚Äôm surprised that the authors do not recommend this by default.</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong></p>

<p><em>Modified FNV with good avalanche behavior and uniform distribution with larger hash sizes.</em></p>

        const uint p = 16777619;

            hash = (hash ^ b) * p;

}</pre>
<p>I don‚Äôt recommend using 32-bit FNV as a general-purpose hash as-is. It can produce uniform output, but its suitability needs to be tested for each class of keys for which you intend to use it. It is likely to produce non-uniform output if you have more than 2<sup>14</sup> or 2<sup>15</sup> hash buckets. If the CPU architecture does not have fast integer multiplication, use a shift-add-xor hash instead.</p>
<p>If you want to use an FNV-style hash function, I recommend using the modified version listed in Figure fnv4. This version passes all the uniform distribution tests above and it achieves avalanche for every tested combination of input and output bits (green squares everywhere). No xor-folding step is required.</p>
<p>The only difference between this version and the original version is that the mixing steps occurs <em>after</em> the combining step in each round, and it adds a post-processing step to mix the bits even further. These two changes completely correct the avalanche behavior of the function. As a result, this version of FNV passes all of the œá<sup>2</sup> tests above, all the way up to 2<sup>16</sup> buckets. I haven‚Äôt tested larger sizes but I suspect it would be OK there as well.</p>

<p data-sanitized-class="text">We present <em>StyleDrop</em> that enables the generation of images that faithfully follow a specific style, powered by <a href="https://muse-model.github.io/">Muse</a>, a text-to-image generative vision transformer. <em>StyleDrop</em> is extremely versatile and captures nuances and details of a user-provided style, such as color schemes, shading, design patterns, and local and global effects. <em>StyleDrop</em> works by efficiently learning a new style by fine-tuning very few trainable parameters (less than 1% of total model parameters), and improving the quality via iterative training with either human or automated feedback. Better yet, <em>StyleDrop</em> is able to deliver impressive results even when the user supplies only a <em>single</em> image specifying the desired style. An extensive study shows that, for the task of style tuning text-to-image models, Styledrop on <a href="https://muse-model.github.io/">Muse</a> convincingly outperforms other methods, including <a href="https://dreambooth.github.io/">DreamBooth</a> and <a href="https://textual-inversion.github.io/">Textual Inversion</a> on <a href="https://imagen.research.google/">Imagen</a> or <a href="https://stability.ai/stable-diffusion">Stable Diffusion</a>.</p>

				<div class="text"><p>I‚Äôm an embedded systems engineer. I spend a lot of my free time looking for things I could use in future designs, or things that tickle one of my fancies.</p>
<p>One of those things is cheap Linux-capable computers, the cheaper the better. So I started diving into the very deep rabbit hole of obscure processors.</p>
<p>I thought to myself, ‚ÄúThese processors are nearly cheap enough to give away.‚Äù After a while I hit upon the idea of making a barebones Linux board in a business card form factor.</p>
<p>As soon as I had the idea I thought it would be pretty cool to do. I have <a href="https://hackaday.com/2017/10/04/literally-flashy-business-cards/">seen</a> electronic <a href="https://hackaday.com/2014/06/17/designing-the-second-version-of-my-business-card/">business</a> cards <a href="https://hackaday.com/2018/05/11/stylish-business-card-with-a-stylophone-built-in/">before</a>, with various fun features including emulating USB flash drives, blinkenlights, or even wireless transceivers. I have never seen one running Linux, however.</p>
<p>So I built one.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/businesscard-top.jpg"><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/businesscard-top_huad90566bef925e8b01048d4355f78bd6_6751801_1024x1024_fit_q80_box.jpg" title="(click for large version)"></a></figure><p>This is the finished product. It is a complete, minimal ARM computer running my customized Linux firmware built with Buildroot.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/businesscard-bottom.jpg"><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/businesscard-bottom_hu0304cb7e538da5a35ca6f72df4bbc0a9_7893599_1024x1024_fit_q80_box.jpg" title="(click for large version)"></a></figure><p>It has a USB port in the corner. If you plug it into a computer, it boots in about 6 seconds and shows up over USB as a flash drive and a virtual serial port that you can use to log into the card‚Äôs shell. The flash drive has a README file, a copy of my r√©sum√©, and some of my photography. The shell has several games and Unix classics such as fortune and rogue, a small 2048, and a small MicroPython interpreter.</p>
<p>All this is accomplished on a very small 8MB flash chip. The bootloader fits in 256KB, the kernel is 1.6MB, and the whole root filesystem is 2.4MB. So, there‚Äôs plenty of space for the virtual flash drive. It also includes a writable home directory, on the off chance that anyone creates something they want to keep. This is also saved on the flash chip, which is properly wear leveled with UBI.</p>
<p>The whole thing costs under $3. It‚Äôs cheap enough to give away. If you get one from me, I‚Äôm probably trying to impress you.</p>
<h2 data-sanitized-id="design-and-assembly">Design and assembly</h2>
<p>I designed and built everything myself. This is literally my job, and I enjoy it, so much of the challenge was finding parts that were cheap enough for a hobbyist.</p>
<p>The choice of processor was the most critical decision to keep the cost low and make the project feasible. After much research, I selected the F1C100s, a fairly obscure cost-optimized (read: <em>damn cheap</em>) part made by Allwinner; it includes both RAM and CPU in a single package. I bought these on Taobao. All the other miscellaneous components were sourced from LCSC.</p>
<p>I fabricated the PCBs with <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">JLC</a>. For $8 I got 10 copies. I have been very impressed with boards I‚Äôve gotten from JLC; they‚Äôre not quite as nice as the ones from OSHPark, but they look great, especially for the price.</p>
<p>The first spin of the boards were matte black, which looked fine but were quite the fingerprint magnets.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/businesscard-v1-top.jpg"><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/businesscard-v1-top_hufbc4863b7048e03811fce4d4bb545c2d_2395351_1024x1024_fit_q80_box.jpg" title="(click for large version)"></a></figure><p>There were a couple problems with the first spin: first, the USB port wasn‚Äôt long enough to reliably make contact in many USB ports. Less critically, the flash footprint was wrong, which I worked around by bending the leads under the part by hand. (My wife said I was ‚Äúdead-spidering‚Äù the part!)</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/dead-spider.jpg"><img src="../themes/icons/grey.gif" data-original="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/my-business-card-runs-linux/dead-spider_hub9f0c46128e70c3e8e3772be08b379bb_215180_1024x1024_fit_q80_box.jpg" title="(click for large version)"></a></figure><p>Once I had validated everything else, I re-spun the boards to get the version you see at the top of this article.</p>
<p>Due to the size of all these small parts, right away I decided to reflow solder everything using a <a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/08/t962-reflow-profile-calculator/">cheap reflow oven</a>. I have access to a laser cutter, so I laser-cut my own solder paste stencil using laminator pages. The stencil turned out reasonably well. The 0.2mm apertures for the processor pins needed special attention to get them to come out clean: laser power and focus were critical.</p>

<h3 data-sanitized-id="bill-of-materials--cost">Bill of Materials &amp; Cost</h3>
<p>I kept costs low. It‚Äôs cheap enough that I don‚Äôt feel bad giving it away, as designed! I‚Äôm not going to give one to absolutely everyone because it does take time to assemble each card, and assembly cost is not factored in here (my time is ‚Äúfree‚Äù).</p>
<table><thead><tr><th>Component</th>
<th>Price</th>
</tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>F1C100s</td>
<td>$1.42</td>

</tr></tbody></table><p>Of course, there are other costs that are difficult to quantify like shipping (since it‚Äôs spread across multiple projects). But this is definitely pretty cheap for a Linux board. It also gives a pretty decent starting point for quantifying how much it costs companies to manufacture bottom-end devices: you bet they‚Äôre getting everything even cheaper than I am!</p>
<h2 data-sanitized-id="capabilities">Capabilities</h2>
<p>What can I say? It boots a super stripped-down Linux in about 6 seconds. Due to form factor and cost, the card lacks I/O, networking, and any amount of storage to run heavyweight programs. Nonetheless, I managed to cram a bunch of interesting stuff into the firmware image.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-id="usb">USB</h3>
<p>I could do any number of things with the USB, but I chose to keep it fairly simple so that people could have a decent chance of getting everything working on their computer when they tried it out. Linux lets you behave as a ‚Äúdevice‚Äù with the <a href="https://linux-sunxi.org/USB_Gadget">Gadget Framework</a>. Since I forward-ported some drivers from others' previous work on this processor, I have all the functionality of the entire USB gadget framework at my disposal. I decided to emulate a pre-generated flash drive and supply a shell over a virtual serial port.</p>
<h3 data-sanitized-id="shell">Shell</h3>
<p>You can run all these from the emulated serial console after you log in (as <code>root</code>, the only user):</p>
<ul><li><strong><code>rogue</code></strong>: the classic Unix dungeon crawler.</li>
<li><strong><code>2048</code></strong>: a simple console mode 2048 game.</li>
<li><strong><code>fortune</code></strong>: various pithy sayings. I decided not to include the entire database of quotes here to save space for other functionality.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://micropython.org/"><code>micropython</code></a></strong>: a very small Python interpreter.</li>
</ul><h3 data-sanitized-id="emulated-flash-drive">Emulated Flash Drive</h3>
<p>During the compilation process, the build tools generate a small FAT32 image and add it as one of the UBI partitions. As I described above, the Linux gadget subsystem presents this as a mass storage device to the PC.</p>
<p>If you‚Äôd like to see what appears on the flash drive, the easiest thing to do would be to go <a href="https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/businesscard-linux/tree/master/package/businesscard-flashdrive/files">look at the source code</a>. There‚Äôs some of my photography and my resume.</p>

<p>If you‚Äôd like to see my Buildroot tree, it‚Äôs open-sourced on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/businesscard-linux"><strong><code>thirtythreeforty/businesscard-linux</code></strong></a>. It contains the code to generate the NOR flash image, which is then installed via the processor‚Äôs USB download mode. It also has package definitions for the games and other goodies like fortune that I packaged for Buildroot once I got everything working. If you‚Äôre wanting to use the F1C100s in a project, it‚Äôs a great starting point (and feel free to get in touch if you have questions).</p>

<p>I rebased <a href="https://github.com/Icenowy/linux/tree/f1c100s">Icenowy‚Äôs excellent F1C100s work</a> on Linux v4.9.

<p>I believe I currently have the world‚Äôs best port of U-Boot to the F1C100s, based again in part on some work by Icenowy. (Surprisingly, getting U-Boot fully working was quite annoying.) I am working on upstreaming this. In the meantime, it is also on GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/thirtythreeforty/u-boot/tree/f1c100s-v2019.04"><strong><code>thirtythreeforty/u-boot</code></strong></a>.</p>

<h2 data-sanitized-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I taught myself a lot on this project: it‚Äôs my first project using a reflow oven to solder the parts. I also had to learn how to find resources for poorly-documented parts. There was a lot more to it than what I touched on in this quick presentation; again, if you want to see how the sausage gets made, see also my <a href="https://www.thirtythreeforty.net/posts/2019/12/designing-my-linux-business-card/">companion detailed write-up</a>.</p>
<p>I drew from my existing experience with embedded Linux and designing PCBs. It isn‚Äôt flawless, but it‚Äôs a pretty good representation of my abilities.</p>
