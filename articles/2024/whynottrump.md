In no particular order. I will mark a (K) next to any of these traits I also feel are shared by his opponent.

>*Despotic and incredulous nature  
>*Not encouraging additional financial support for Ukraine  
>*Stating he would resolve the war in Ukraine after he is elected, but before he is sworn-in, showing a lack of respect for [the hatch act](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hatch_Act)  
>*Lack of ownership and responsibility for any situation, but especially actions taken by his supporters at the US Capitol  
>*Stated desire to overturn "all rules, regulations, and articles, even those found in the Constitution" due to the 2020 election  
>*Putting himself first in all situations  
>*Lack of respect toward those around him (mocking disabled people)  
>*Stated desire to fire experts and experienced military leaders  
>*Accepted endorsement of RFK, who is directly responsible for at least dozens of deaths in Samoa via his work in Children's Health Defense  
>*Friendly association with nationalists and racists, such as Laura Loomer and Nick Fuentes  
>*Propsed tax of 10% to 20% on all imported goods (except those he deigns to wave), driving up the costs of imported goods  
>*Tendency towards economic nationalism and the "America First" economic agenda focused on increasing manufacturing and exports and limiting imports  
>*Hateful rhetoric towards those he perceives as enemies  
>*Hateful rhetoric toward immigrants  
>*Feigned incredulity about his opponent's race and background  
>*Friendly language toward dictators, who he perceives as strong, such as Putin and Orban  
>*Stating that he trusts Putin over U.S. intelligence "lowlifes"  
>*Consistent lack of respect towards all veterans, but especially those who were injured or captured, and Medal of Honor recipients  
>*Consistent lack of respect (putting it mildly) towards women and girls, including his own daughter and wives  
>*Has been found liable for sexual assault and is a felon  
>*Inability to admit he lost the 2020 election  
>*Attempted to overturn the results of the 2020 election by: pressuring state election representatives to "find him votes", speaking at the national monument and encouraging his supporters to march on the Capitol and take the country back, attempt to have Mike Pence fail to certify the election or use a false slate of electors


The list above is incomplete, in terms of content and citation, but all the points within are either easily searchable or obviously true.

I will leave you with this speech (underline emphasis my own) from Benjamin Franklin on the importance of compromise in the Constitution.

## Closing Speech at the Constitutional Convention (1787)
 
>I confess that I do not entirely approve of this Constitution at present, but Sir, I am not sure I shall never approve it: <u>For having lived long, I have experienced many Instances of being oblig’d, by better Information or fuller Consideration, to change Opinions even on important Subjects, which I once thought right, but found to be otherwise.  
>It is therefore that the older I grow the more apt I am to doubt my own Judgment and to pay more Respect to the Judgment of others.</u>  <br><br>
>Most Men indeed as well as most Sects in Religion, think themselves in Possession of all Truth, and that wherever others differ from them it is so far Error. [Sir Richard] Steele, a Protestant, in a Dedication tells the Pope, that the only Difference between our two Churches in their Opinions of the Certainty of their Doctrine, is, the Romish Church is infallible, and the Church of England is never in the Wrong. But tho’ many private Persons think almost as highly of their own Infallibility, as that of their Sect, few express it so naturally as a certain French lady, who in a little Dispute with her Sister, said, I don’t know how it happens, Sister, but I meet with no body but myself that’s always in the right.  <br><br>
>In these Sentiments, Sir, I agree to this Constitution, with all its Faults, if they are such: because I think a General Government necessary for us, and there is no Form of Government but what may be a Blessing to the People if well administred; <u>and I believe farther that this is likely to be well administred for a Course of Years, and can only end in Despotism as other Forms have done before it, when the People shall become so corrupted as to need Despotic Government, being incapable of any other.</u> I doubt too whether any other Convention we can obtain, may be able to make a better Constitution: <u>For when you assemble a Number of Men to have the Advantage of their joint Wisdom, you inevitably assemble with those Men all their Prejudices, their Passions, their Errors of Opinion, their local Interests, and their selfish Views. From such an Assembly can a perfect Production be expected?</u> <br><br>
It therefore astonishes me, Sir, to find this System approaching so near to Perfection as it does; and I think it will astonish our Enemies, who are waiting with Confidence to hear that our Councils are confounded, like those of the Builders of Babel, and that our States are on the Point of Separation, only to meet hereafter for the Purpose of cutting one another’s Throats. Thus I consent, Sir, to this Constitution <u>because I expect no better, and because I am not sure that it is not the best.</u> The Opinions I have had of its Errors, I sacrifice to the Public Good. I have never whisper’d a Syllable of them abroad. Within these Walls they were born, & here they shall die. If every one of us in returning to our Constituents were to report the Objections he has had to it, and endeavour to gain Partizans in support of them, we might prevent its being generally received, and thereby lose all the salutary Effects & great Advantages resulting naturally in our favour among foreign Nations, as well as among ourselves, from our real or apparent Unanimity. Much of the Strength and Efficiency of any Government, in procuring & securing Happiness to the People depends on Opinion, on the general Opinion of the Goodness of that Government as well as of the Wisdom & Integrity of its Governors. I hope therefore that for our own Sakes, as a Part of the People, and for the Sake of our Posterity, we shall act heartily & unanimously in recommending this Constitution, wherever our Influence may extend, and turn our future Thoughts and Endeavours to the Means of having it well administred.  <br><br>
>On the whole, Sir, I cannot help expressing a Wish, that every Member of the Convention, who may still have Objections to it, would <u>with me on this Occasion doubt a little of his own Infallibility, and to make manifest our Unanimity, put his Name to this Instrument.</u>
