## Is this quote spurious?

I can't find any valid source for this quote. GoodReads doesn't provide a source, and I can't find one searching in Spanish and English. 

What would even be the original Spanish of this quote? The translator says it would be "No hables a menos que puedas mejorar el silencio".

When searching for this quote, I found a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=snX3ih4pz1o) with this explanation in the comments.

> Esta frase no es de un libro de Borges. Aunque suele ser atribuida a él, no se encuentra en ninguna de sus obras. De hecho, esta idea ha circulado por varias culturas y filosofías. La pusimos porque representa muy bien la importancia del silencio y la reflexión. Sin embargo, es más una de esas frases populares que se atribuyen a grandes pensadores sin que esté del todo claro su origen exacto.

> This phrase is not from a Borges book. Although it is usually attributed to him, it is not found in any of his works. In fact, this idea has circulated through various cultures and philosophies. We put it because it represents very well the importance of silence and reflection. However, it is more one of those popular phrases that are attributed to great thinkers without its exact origin being entirely clear.

Well besides there are many better Borges quotes. And it seems likely to me that Borges would not even agree with this given his own incredulity about the appeal of his works. I feel that Borges thinks more that he **has to write**, not that his writing is necessarily an improvement.
