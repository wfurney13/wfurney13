            Have you ever noticed that YouTube is way worse than it used to be? It's time we got rid of YouTube shorts,
            sponsors, clickbait titles and thumbnails, and those <a class="inline" ; target="_blank" ;
                href="marg.html">insane comments.</a> The goal of this post is to help you
            enhance YouTube so that it resembles the good old days... or at least makes it usable.

        <p class="pbody">This post will help you install browser extensions. Browser extensions are a top threat
            vector for malicious software and often contain "anonymous" data collection routines about your browsing
            activity <sup><a class="note" ; href="#fn1">1</a></sup>. You should only install browser extensions that
            <i>you</i> trust. I make no claims about the safety of these particular extensions. I would recommend
            having
            as few browser extensions as you can to minimize risk. I always ensure that they are open source, heavily
            utilized, and read through the source code and issues pages on Github. I would not install even an open
            source extension if the code
            looks obsfucated or is too complicated to understand -- or if there are concerning issues (be sure to check
            the
            closed issues as well). If in doubt about a browser extension, don't install it and move on.

        <p class="pemp">Remove YouTube Shorts</p>
        <p class="pbody">I don't think this type of
            short form content is good and so opt to remove it entirely. Note that the filter can be modified if you
            only want
            to remove shorts from the homepage or something like that. To do this we will make use of UBlock Origin's
            custom
            filter rules.

        <p class="pemp">Reddit Comments for YouTube</p>
        <p class="pbody">As the old adage goes, the only thing worse than Reddit comments is YouTube comments. OK, maybe
            I just made that up, but I still think it's true. I've used two extensions for this in the past <a
                class="inline" target="_blank" ; href="https://github.com/odensc/karamel">Karamel</a> and <a
                class="inline" target="_blank" ; href="https://github.com/Xyl-AU/Reddit-Comments-for-YouTube">Reddit
                Comments for
                YouTube</a>. Both seem to work well and give you an option to see all the reddit threads for a video as
            well as the YouTube comments. </p>
        <p class="pemp">SponsorBlock</p>
        <p class="pbody">Not too long ago YouTube videos didn't have sponsors. Ajay's <a class="inline" ;
                target="_blank" ; href="https://github.com/ajayyy/SponsorBlock">SponsorBlock</a> helps by crowdsourcing
            sponsored portions of videos (which seems to work really well) and auto-skipping them. It also has some
            other cool features, like skipping to highlights of the video and skipping intros and outros.</p>
        <p class="pemp">De-Arrow</p>
        <p class="pbody">By the same author as (and built on top of) SponsorBlock, <a class="inline" ; target="_blank" ;
                href="https://github.com/ajayyy/DeArrow">De-Arrow</a> is another extension (currently in beta) that uses
            crowdsourcing to
            replace video titles and thumbnails with their crowdsourced equivalents or a fallback. There are lots of
            options here as
            well. For example, you can choose to replace uppercase words in titles with Title Case, remove all emojis
            from titles, replace thumbnails with random screenshots from the middle of the video, and more. Fair warning
            that this one
            seems to be a bit quirkier with the crowdsourcing than SponsorBlock. That makes sense when you
            consider
            that really only nerds are submitting title and thumbnail replacement suggestions, but hopefully it will
            trend toward
            a better experience when more users come onboard. </p>
