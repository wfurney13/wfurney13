      Earlier this week the NASA mission OSIRIS-REx returned a sample of the asteroid Bennu to Earth. The YouTube
      comments on
      many such stories really need to be seen to be believed.<sup><a id="fn1ref" class="note"  href="/articles/marg#fn1">1</a></sup>
      Here, for
      instance, we see a member of the retreival team beginning to inspect the payload:
      <br>
      <br>
      <a href='https://postimg.cc/75D3b1FL' target='_blank'><img src='https://i.postimg.cc/YCLbnb8Q/IMG-1844.jpg'
          border='0' alt='IMG-1844' /></a><br />
<code style="font-style: italic font-size: small"><br>YouTube Comment Exchange:<br>"They expect us to believe that's a real Hazmat suit with the hair showing, lol"<br>"Dude that's a sweatshirt"</code><br>
<br>
      Another such discussion involved an artist's rendition of the probe gathering the sample, the comments were filled
      with things like,
      "there's
      no
      way that's real" and "they can't possibly think that we would believe this". YouTube community post comments
      for major news outlets are an absolute goldmine for this kind of stuff — and this is not a minority of the
      comments — it's a loud <i>majority</i>. It could be NASA missions, someone having a heart attack ("musta been the
      jab"), or whatever else.

<p class="pemp">AI development will exacerbate this in myriad ways</p>
<p>Even if all future development of LLMs,
      StableDiffusion, DeepFake technologies, etc, were halted today, we are still in for a world of
      trouble with what's <a class="inline"  target="_blank" 
        href="https://x.com/8teAPi/status/1706520893621784780?s=20">already</a> <a class="inline"
        href="https://x.com/PatrickJBlum/status/1706354581989626323">available.</a>
      People won't only believe that AI generated content is human-generated, but they'll believe, with probably
      increasing ferocity, that <i>real</i> content has been faked. If the majority of content on the internet is still
      created by humans, <a class="inline"  target="_blank" 
        href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/09/ai-generated-books-force-amazon-to-cap-ebook-publications-to-3-per-day/">that
        won't be the case</a> for long.
      <br><br>
      With outside-the-box approaches we can develop tools to help fight against some of this in the short-term.
      Search engines like <a class="inline"  target="_blank" 
        href="https://www.marginalia.nu/marginalia-search/about/">Marginalia</a> can be used to do 'reverse SEO'
      searching to find some old-school
      human content. This type of search is a welcome reprieve from the modern internet's
      litany of
      listicles, AI generated spam, and bloatsites.

      As for the ancillary issue, well... people have always believed wacky things, right? Yes, conservatives are going
